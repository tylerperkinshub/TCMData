"Storyline": "In the first year of World War I, in New England, belligerent young Thad Walker steals a car and is involved in a hit-and-run accident.  Resentful of his father's outrage over the event and fearful of being arrested, Thad stows away on board a ship, joining his friends Bill Wellman, Duke Sinclair and Tom Hitchcock on their way to join the French Foreign Legion.   In Paris, the boys frequent a bar popular with flyers and learn of the recent formation of the Lafayette Escadrille, an aerial unit made up of American volunteers, and decide to enlist.  Meanwhile, Thad is captivated by a young, blonde girl, Renée Beaulieu, and, promising to meet the others the next day, leaves with her.  The following morning after a tender departure from Renée, Thad joins the others at the air training camp at Luxeuil and within days the volunteers are drilling and taking instructions on \"penguin\" planes, which do not fly, but teach steering and control.   The high-spirited young men continually taunt their French instructors and destroy several of the penguins in their enthusiasm.   One afternoon, Thad knocks out one of the other enlistees who, upon seeing a photo of Renée, called her a \"hustler.\"  Later, Thad confides in Bill that Renée had confessed that she was indeed a prostitute, but he does not care.  During drilling exercises, Thad is impatient and resentful of being prevented  from flying.  When Renée writes to declare that she has quit working for the madam and moved into a small apartment, Thad decides to visit her.   After safely slipping away unnoticed from the camp, Thad spends a romantic evening with Renée, but becomes discouraged upon returning to the endless drilling at camp.  Angered when he is reprimanded by the drill instructor one afternoon, Thad strikes the man and is placed under arrest.  That night, Duke tells Bill and Tom that Thad faces severe punishment for striking an officer, and suggests they break him out.  The friends agree and stage a large brawl that attracts the guards, allowing Thad to escape.   Later walking along in the dark toward Paris, Thad realizes that his distinctive uniform will attract attention and stops a solitary soldier on the road to plead with him for his coat.  When the soldier refuses, the men have a vicious fight.  Although severely beaten, Thad reaches Renée, who, with the help of the concierge, tends to his wounds.  While Thad recovers over the next few weeks at Renée's, the men of the Lafayette Escadrille continue training and are soon flying.   After his recuperation, Thad grows restless as he cannot go outside in the daytime for fear of being stopped by gendarmes searching for deserters.  Thad asks Renée to marry him and she agrees when they are able to get to a church.  Determined, Thad finds a Bible and the couple exchange vows over it.  Uncomfortable at being supported by Renée, who now works as a tram conductor, Thad decides to visit the madam to ask for work procuring customers.  Renée is unhappy with Thad's choice, but he convinces her that he will keep the job only until he has saved enough money to take them both to South America.  Back at Luxeuil several weeks later, the boys earn their wings and come into Paris to celebrate.  Thad spots his friends in the bar where he trolls for customers, but, humiliated, leaves before they spot him.   Soon after, the men of the Escadrille are sent to the south to train on the latest aircraft before their transfer to Bar-le-Duc near Verdun, where they are on call as replacement flyers at the front line in Alsace Lorraine.  After months of combat flying, the men have become hardened veterans, yet greet America's official entrance into the war enthusiastically.  Distraught when he hears the news of America's war declaration, Thad risks telling his story to an American general who is a regular customer at madam's.   Pleading for the opportunity to fly for his own country and regain his self-respect, Thad is grateful when the general agrees to help him.   Soon, Thad is back in uniform training at the U. S. camp at Issoudun and wins his wings.  Although fearful for Thad, Renée encourages him and vows to wait for his return.  On a solo reconnaissance flight, Thad is unknowingly stalked by a German ace who is forced to abandon his attack when his guns jam.   Later, Thad visits the Lafayette Flying Corp to reunite with Bill, Duke and Tom and accepts an invitation to join them on a mission.   The group comes across a German air squad and engages them in a vicious dog fight, during which Thad performs valiantly.   His pride and confidence restored, Thad asks his friends to join him in Paris where he officially weds Renée in church.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Jane Eyre",
"Storyline": "In 1829, nine-year-old orphan Jane Eyre lives at the English estate of her cruel aunt, Mrs. Reed, who favors her spoiled son John over the spirited Jane.  Determined to be rid of Jane, Mrs. Reed sends her to Lowood Institution, an austere boarding school for orphaned and impoverished children, which is run by Henry Brocklehurst. Brocklehurst, a sadistic prig, warns the teachers and students to shun Jane, but kindhearted pupil Helen shares a meager portion of bread with her. Despite her disappointment over Lowood's austerity, Jane enjoys learning and her friendship with Helen deepens.  Jane also appreciates the attention of Dr. Rivers, who tends to the pupils of Lowood and advises Brocklehurst to treat them more humanely.  One day, Brocklehurst cuts off Helen's curly hair, then orders her and Jane to march in the rain as punishment for their \"vanity\" and \"rebelliousness.\"  The harsh experience proves fatal for Helen, and Jane loses her gentle friend.  After Helen's death, Dr. Rivers encourages Jane to bury her grief and continue her education, which she does during the next ten years. In 1839, Brocklehurst offers Jane a teaching job, but she is determined to escape Lowood. After placing an ad seeking a position as a governess, Jane travels to a country estate known as Thornfield, where she is met by Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper.  Mrs. Fairfax explains that Jane's pupil is a French girl named Adele, who is the ward of Thornfield's absent master, Edward Rochester.  One evening, while Jane is taking a walk, a rider on horseback rises out of the mist and almost tramples her.  The imperious rider twists his ankle when he falls, then rudely departs without divulging his name.  Upon her return to Thornfield, Jane learns that the rider was Rochester, who mystifies her with his contradictory nature.  Mrs. Fairfax advises Jane to make allowances for Rochester, who often stays away from Thornfield because of the unpleasant memories it holds.  When Rochester seeks out Jane the next day, he is pleased by her honest admission that she does not find him handsome, and the rapport between them builds.  That night, Jane is awakened by eerie laughter and when she rushes into the hallway, sees smoke coming from Rochester's bedroom.  Jane awakens Rochester before he is consumed by the fire, and he allows her to assume that the blaze was set by Grace Poole, a supposedly unstable seamstress living in a little-used wing of the mansion.  Although the incident draws the couple closer, the next morning, Jane is distressed to learn that Rochester has left for a house party at the home of Blanche Ingraham.  The winter passes without word from Rochester, until one day, the household learns that he is to arrive with Blanche and other guests.  Much to Jane's dismay, Mrs. Fairfax insinuates that Blanche will soon become Rochester's wife.  Jane grows more troubled upon meeting the beautiful, haughty Blanche, but both she and Rochester feel their bond grow stronger when they talk.  Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Mason, of Spanish Town, Jamaica, and Jane does not see Rochester again until late that night when she is awakened by screams.  Rochester escorts Jane to the wing habited by Grace and there she tends to Mason, who has been wounded.  Rochester sends Mason away with a doctor, then walks with Jane, who thinks that Grace instigated the attack.  Rochester states that he is to be married, and later, tells Jane that he will find a new position for her, as she believes that his bride will send Adele away to school.  Soon after, Rochester accuses Blanche of caring more for his money than for him, and she leaves with her family and the other guests.  Rochester then tests Jane by informing her that he has found another position for her, and when she finally confesses her love for him, he passionately proposes.  Adele is thrilled that Jane is to be her new mother, but Mason stops the wedding ceremony by announcing that Rochester is already married to Mason's sister Bertha. Rochester then leads the wedding party to Thornfield and shows them Bertha, who is violently insane. Soon after, Jane tells Rochester for the last time that she loves him and leaves the mansion, despite his pleas for her to stay.  With nowhere else to go, Jane returns to Mrs. Reed, who has fallen ill, and nurses her until her death.  Jane learns from Dr. Rivers that Rochester has been inquiring after her, but she asks him not to reply.  One night, however, Jane believes that she hears Rochester calling her name in great torment, and she rushes back to Thornfield.  There she is told by Mrs. Fairfax that Bertha set the mansion on fire and Rochester was seriously injured in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue her.  Just then, Rochester enters the ruins of the mansion, and Jane realizes that he is blind. She is overjoyed to be reunited with him, and her passion convinces him that she feels more for him than mere pity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "It Came from Beneath the Sea",
"Storyline": "On a peacetime patrol in the Pacific, the U.S. Navy's atomic submarine, captained by Commander Pete Mathews, is chased and held by an enormous, unidentifiable object.  The sub picks up strong radioactive signals from outside the ship, but Pete's evasive maneuvers eventually wrench the vessel free.  Upon returning to the Pearl Harbor naval base in Honolulu, a strange substance is discovered lodged on the ship's plates, prompting the Defense Department to summon two marine biology experts, Dr. John Carter and Dr. Lesley Joyce, to the base.  After an initial exam, both Lesley and John agree that the substance came from a living creature, despite Pete and the Navy's incredulity.  Over the following two weeks, as John and Lesley continue their investigation, Pete shows a personal interest in Lesley, who is only anxious to return to her own research.  Finally, John and Lesley present their findings, stating that their tests suggest that the submarine was attacked by a giant octopus, which apparently was disturbed from its nest deep in the Pacific's Mindanao Straights by radioactive contamination from the atomic bomb fallout over Japan. Lesley explains that the unusual radioactive charge given off by the creature alerts its prey of its approach, and in desperation the octopus has surfaced in search of food. John and Lesley speculate that unexplained disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may have been due to the octopus.  Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt over this hypothesis, however, and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley with departure arrangements, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat, from which several men escaped in a raft. John and Lesley are once again pressed into service for the government.  The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, but when the first sailor's description of an attack by a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify.  Lesley is able to convince the first sailor to repeat his story for the government officials, who now have the evidence they need to back up the scientists' premise. The government then halts all sea traffic in the North Pacific without revealing the reason to other countries. John flies out to sea to trace a missing ship, while Pete and Lesley follow up a report of three missing people on the coast of Oregon. The local sheriff, Bill Nash, takes them to the site of the attack along the beach, where they find a giant suction imprint in the sand and request that John join them.  While waiting, Pete and Lesley fish all day to no avail, and are convinced that the giant creature may be in the vicinity.  After John arrives and the imprint is definitively identified as octopus, Pete demands Lesley leave the project, which now threatens to become dangerous, but she steadfastly refuses.  When Bill is attacked along the beach by the creature in front of the scientists, they hastily arrange for the entire Pacific coast waters to be mined before departing for San Francisco and the Navy's central headquarters. An electrified safety net is strung underwater across the entrance to San Francisco Bay to protect the Golden Gate Bridge, which is also wired. John takes a helicopter along the shore and baits the sea with dead sharks in an effort to lure the octopus back inland. Lesley demonstrates to reporters a special jet-propelled atomic torpedo, with which they hope to shoot the creature and then drive it to sea before detonating the device. Later that day, the giant octopus demolishes the net across the Bay and heads toward San Francisco. The Navy orders the Golden Gate Bridge abandoned, but when John learns that the electric circuit on the bridge remains on, races out to shut it off.  The bridge is attacked by the creature, but Pete rescues John before one section collapses.  The residents of the city panic and begin a mass exodus down the peninsula, as the Navy struggles to evacuate the Embarcadero, which is then battered by the octopus.  When several more people are attacked, the Defense Department authorizes Pete to launch his submarine and the atomic warhead.  John joins Pete while Lesley remains at the base.  Flame throwers push the octopus back into the sea, but when Pete shoots the creature, it grabs the submarine.  Using an aqualung, Pete swims out to the octopus and places explosive charges on it before being knocked out by the creature's flailing arms. John then swims out, shoots the octopus in the eye, forcing it to release the ship, and pulls Pete to safety.  Back at the base, as the creature turns toward open sea, the torpedo is detonated, destroying the giant octopus. Later, while celebrating, Lesley agrees to continue seeing Pete after she and John finish their next research project.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Lesley explains that the unusual radioactive charge given off by the creature alerts its prey of its approach, and in desperation the octopus has surfaced in search of food. John and Lesley speculate that unexplained disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may have been due to the octopus.  Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt over this hypothesis, however, and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley with departure arrangements, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat, from which several men escaped in a raft. John and Lesley are once again pressed into service for the government.  The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, but when the first sailor's description of an attack by a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify.  Lesley is able to convince the first sailor to repeat his story for the government officials, who now have the evidence they need to back up the scientists' premise. The government then halts all sea traffic in the North Pacific without revealing the reason to other countries. John flies out to sea to trace a missing ship, while Pete and Lesley follow up a report of three missing people on the coast of Oregon. The local sheriff, Bill Nash, takes them to the site of the attack along the beach, where they find a giant suction imprint in the sand and request that John join them.  While waiting, Pete and Lesley fish all day to no avail, and are convinced that the giant creature may be in the vicinity.  After John arrives and the imprint is definitively identified as octopus, Pete demands Lesley leave the project, which now threatens to become dangerous, but she steadfastly refuses.  When Bill is attacked along the beach by the creature in front of the scientists, they hastily arrange for the entire Pacific coast waters to be mined before departing for San Francisco and the Navy's central headquarters. An electrified safety net is strung underwater across the entrance to San Francisco Bay to protect the Golden Gate Bridge, which is also wired. John takes a helicopter along the shore and baits the sea with dead sharks in an effort to lure the octopus back inland. Lesley demonstrates to reporters a special jet-propelled atomic torpedo, with which they hope to shoot the creature and then drive it to sea before detonating the device. Later that day, the giant octopus demolishes the net across the Bay and heads toward San Francisco. The Navy orders the Golden Gate Bridge abandoned, but when John learns that the electric circuit on the bridge remains on, races out to shut it off.  The bridge is attacked by the creature, but Pete rescues John before one section collapses.  The residents of the city panic and begin a mass exodus down the peninsula, as the Navy struggles to evacuate the Embarcadero, which is then battered by the octopus.  When several more people are attacked, the Defense Department authorizes Pete to launch his submarine and the atomic warhead.  John joins Pete while Lesley remains at the base.  Flame throwers push the octopus back into the sea, but when Pete shoots the creature, it grabs the submarine.  Using an aqualung, Pete swims out to the octopus and places explosive charges on it before being knocked out by the creature's flailing arms. John then swims out, shoots the octopus in the eye, forcing it to release the ship, and pulls Pete to safety.  Back at the base, as the creature turns toward open sea, the torpedo is detonated, destroying the giant octopus. Later, while celebrating, Lesley agrees to continue seeing Pete after she and John finish their next research project.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "On Christmas Eve in New York City, Gillian Holroyd, the owner of a gallery specializing in native primitive art, laments that her life is devoid of romance.  Gil's interest is piqued by her new upstairs neighbor, publisher Sheperd Henderson.  When Shep returns home from work that evening, he finds a garrulous woman snooping around his apartment who introduces herself as Queenie Holroyd, his neighbor.  After Shep brusquely ushers Queenie, who unknown to him is a witch, out of his apartment, she glares at his phone and casts a spell on it.  Upon discovering that his phone is out of order, Shep goes downstairs and asks to use Gil's phone.  As he dials a number, Queenie, who is Gil's aunt, walks into the gallery and urges her to steal Shep away from his fiancée.  Gil, who is also a witch, realizes that Queenie has rendered Gil's phone inoperable and chastises her for inappropriately using her magical powers.  Before Shep leaves to meet his fiancée, Queenie mentions that she and Gil are going to the Zodiac Club that night.  Later at the club, as Gil's bongo-playing, warlock brother Nicky beats his drums, Gil tells Queenie that she longs to forswear her witchery and become \"ordinary.\"  Soon after, Shep enters with his snobbish fiancée, Merle Kittridge.  When Gil recognizes the condescending Merle as the woman with whom she went to college and who reported her to the dean for not wearing shoes, she decides to exact revenge on her.  Recalling that Merle is terrified of thunder, Gil simulates a thunderstorm by using her powers to direct Nicky and the other musicians to blare their instruments into Merle's ear, sending her screaming from the club.  At Gil's gallery later that night, the Holroyds exchange Christmas gifts and Nicky gives Gil a magic potion to summon whomever she desires.  Recalling that Shep expressed interest in best-selling author Sidney Redlitch, Gil uses the potion to bring Redlitch to New York.  When Shep returns home from his date with Merle, he sees flames dancing from a bowl in which Gil has activated the potion.  Alarmed by the fire, Shep raps on Gil's door.  Aware of Gil's feelings for Shep, Nicky and Queenie immediately excuse themselves, after which Gil offers him a drink.  As Shep prattles on about marrying Merle the next day, Gil picks up her magic cat Pyewacket, through whom she channels her spells, and casts a spell on Shep.  After a magical night, Shep finds himself in love with Gil and declares that he feels \"spellbound.\"  That morning, Shep informs an indignant Merle that he wants to \"uncouple.\"  When Shep goes to his office, he finds Redlitch sitting in the waiting room, wondering why he has experienced an inexplicable urge to travel to New York and discuss his new book with Shep.  After Redlitch, an authority on magic, proposes writing an exposé about witches in New York, Shep is skeptical.  Redlitch then brags that he can recognize a witch by the fact that they are unable to blush or cry.  When Redlitch mentions that witches hang out at the Zodiac Club, a shocked Shep invites Redlitch to have a drink with him and Gil at the Zodiac that night.  There, after Redlitch outlines his new book idea to Gil, Gil tells Nicky to derail the project.  Instead, as Nicky walks home with Redlitch, he offers to collaborate on the book for fifty percent of the profits.  When Nicky  states that, as a warlock, he is in a unique position to help Redlitch, the author is skeptical until Nicky casts a spell that makes the street light flash on and off.  In the following days, as Shep and Gil pursue romance, Nicky discloses the secrets of his trade to Redlitch.  When Shep proposes to Gil one night, she demurs because, according to the precepts of witchcraft, falling in love will bring an end to her magical powers.  Gil soon reconsiders, however, and accepts Shep's proposal.  After Gil informs Nicky that she plans to renounce witchcraft and marry Shep, he is incredulous.  Fearful that Shep will discover she was a witch, Gil then asks Nicky to stop helping Redlitch, and when he refuses, warns him that she is going to conjure up one last spell to sabotage the book.  True to her word, Gil hexes Redlitch's manuscript, causing Shep to throw it in the garbage as worthless.  Feeling guilty about using her powers to ensnare Shep, Gil confesses to him that she is a witch and Nicky a warlock, but he thinks she is joking.  As Shep is ruminating over the possibility of Gil being a witch, he runs into Queenie, who confirms that Gil put a spell on him to spite Merle.  Shep then confronts Gil, demanding to know if she ever loved him.  After storming out of the gallery, Shep goes to the Zodiac to talk to Nicky and Redlitch.  They drive him to the home of Mrs. Bianca De Pass, a prominent sorceress, who mixes a potion to break Gil's spell. After reluctantly downing the potion, Shep returns to his apartment to pack up his belongings.  Stopping at the gallery, Shep hands Gil a broom and says goodbye. When Gil spitefully threatens to put a spell on Merle, Shep hurries to her apartment to warn her, but she thinks he has lost his mind.  As Gil prepares to cast her spell, she discovers that Pyewacket is missing.  When Queenie returns Pyewacket to Gil, the feline runs away from her, and as Gil begins to cry, she realizes that she has lost her powers by falling in love.  As the months pass, Gil becomes more and more despondent.  Concerned about her niece's welfare, Queenie decides to reconcile Gil and Shep.  One day, Pyewacket unexpectedly jumps through Shep's office window.  When Shep brings the cat back to Gil at her gallery, he finds that the gruesome primitive masks have been replaced by delicate, colorful shells.  Upon seeing Shep, Gil becomes flustered, blushes and cries.  Realizing that she has lost her magic powers and therefore must be in love with him, Shep embraces her.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Feeling guilty about using her powers to ensnare Shep, Gil confesses to him that she is a witch and Nicky a warlock, but he thinks she is joking.  As Shep is ruminating over the possibility of Gil being a witch, he runs into Queenie, who confirms that Gil put a spell on him to spite Merle.  Shep then confronts Gil, demanding to know if she ever loved him.  After storming out of the gallery, Shep goes to the Zodiac to talk to Nicky and Redlitch.  They drive him to the home of Mrs. Bianca De Pass, a prominent sorceress, who mixes a potion to break Gil's spell. After reluctantly downing the potion, Shep returns to his apartment to pack up his belongings.  Stopping at the gallery, Shep hands Gil a broom and says goodbye. When Gil spitefully threatens to put a spell on Merle, Shep hurries to her apartment to warn her, but she thinks he has lost his mind.  As Gil prepares to cast her spell, she discovers that Pyewacket is missing.  When Queenie returns Pyewacket to Gil, the feline runs away from her, and as Gil begins to cry, she realizes that she has lost her powers by falling in love.  As the months pass, Gil becomes more and more despondent.  Concerned about her niece's welfare, Queenie decides to reconcile Gil and Shep.  One day, Pyewacket unexpectedly jumps through Shep's office window.  When Shep brings the cat back to Gil at her gallery, he finds that the gruesome primitive masks have been replaced by delicate, colorful shells.  Upon seeing Shep, Gil becomes flustered, blushes and cries.  Realizing that she has lost her magic powers and therefore must be in love with him, Shep embraces her.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "In 1940, the Muller family, German-born Kurt, his American wife Sara and their three children, Joshua, Babette and Bodo, the youngest, cross the Mexican border into the United States to visit Sara's family.  In Washington, D.C., Sara's arrival is eagerly awaited by her brother, David Farrelly, her mother Fanny, family friend Anise and their house guests, Rumanian count Teck de Brancovis and his American wife Marthe.  Sara has not seen her family for seventeen years, during which time Kurt, a former engineer, has responded to the Nazi threat in Europe by actively engaging in anti-Fascist work.  Prompted by Fanny's questions to Kurt, Sara explains his work and adds that they have come to the United States so that Kurt can have a much-needed rest in safety. Kurt's safety is illusory, however, because the opportunistic Teck has been currying favor with the Germans in Washington.  When Marthe refuses to question David, with whom she has fallen in love, about Kurt, Teck searches the Mullers' room and finds a locked briefcase containing a gun and some money.  Shortly after Sara discovers the broken lock on the briefcase, the Mullers learn about the arrest of resistance worker Max Freidech.  Later, after Teck and Marthe leave for dinner at the German embassy, Sara tells Fanny and David that she and Kurt are carrying money to aid the underground in Germany. She adds that because Max once saved Kurt from the Gestapo, Kurt will now return to Germany to try to save Max and the other people arrested with him. Later, Kurt turns down Joshua's offer to accompany him to Germany, explaining that his time will come when he is older.  Upon their return from the embasy, Marthe denounces her husband and reveals that she is leaving him.  Realizing that Kurt will be in great danger if the Nazis know that he is returning to Germany, Teck demands $10,000 for his silence.  After Kurt summarily refuses him, David and Fanny agree to pay him off.  While they are out of the room, however, Kurt pulls a gun on Teck and takes him outside, where he kills him. When Fanny and David return, Kurt explains his actions and asks them for two days to make his getaway.  With a new understanding of the dangers Kurt faces, Fanny and David agree to help and give him the money they would have given Teck.  Some time later, when no word has come from Kurt, Joshua declares his intention to search for his father after his next birthday, when he will turn eighteen.  Although Sara is distressed by the thought of losing her son as well as her husband, she admits that when the time comes, she will do her best to be brave.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Bowery Battalion",
"Storyline": "Mistaking a mock air raid over New York City for the real thing, the befuddled Bowery Boys, Whitey, Butch, Chuck and buffoonish Sach, march down to the local Army recruiting office and enlist. When the boisterous and bumbling Slip Mahoney, their erstwhile leader, arrives at the boys's hangout, a soda parlor in the Bowery, proprietor Louie Dumbrowsky reveals the boys's sudden attack of patriotism. Determined to save them and the Army from one another, Slip arrives at the recruitment office demanding to know where the \"incompetent infants\" are.  The perturbed officers trick Slip into enlisting and all five are sent to basic training camp in Stockton, where the boys infuriate the by-the-book Sergeant Frisbee with their antics. After complaining about their ill-fitting uniforms, Slip happens upon better clothes and the well-dressed group, now mistaken for new officers from Fort Bragg, are directed to the Officer's Club, where they keep up the hoax by blundering through the other officers' questions. When Frisbee announces that uniforms have been stolen, the imposters try to tiptoe out of trouble, but the ruse is uncovered and the five are sentenced to the guard house. Meanwhile, the lonely Louie misses the noisy boys and resolves to join the Army again, but the recruitment officers refuse to enlist the old man, even after he describes his fighting past in boisterous detail. Back at Stockton, frustrated by the boys' mischief, Frisbee runs through the rudiments of basic training with Colonel Hatfield, who has offered to be the guinea pig to set the example for the boys. Unable to complete even the simplest arms routine without offending the ranking officer, however, the five are thrown into the guard house again. At the soda parlor, an FBI officer visits Louie, requesting that he go to Washington to attend to important government business. Scared that his taxes are to blame for the invitation, Louie agrees to go and is instead asked to assist in flushing out enemy saboteurs at Army camps. Colonel Masters introduces a plan using the inventor of the hydrogen death ray as bait for the spies and reveals to the Pentagon officials that Louie is the ray's inventor. Advanced to major, Louie is immediately sent to Stockton to begin the assignment.  Now serving as Stockton's wait staff, the boys discover Louie is among them when Hatfield holds a testimonial lunch to introduce the inventor, and the surprised boys dump soup on all those gathered. Once again the boys are sentenced to the guard house, but Major Louie, using his new authority, frees the boys and has them assigned as his orderlies. No sooner does he tell them that only he knows the missing key to the hydrogen ray than his secretary, the sexy blonde undercover agent Marsha Levers, having eavesdropped on the conversation, rushes out to share the news with two other spies, the gentlemanly foreign-born Decker and Conroy, at their desert hideout. Hatfield warns Louie of the danger, and Louie, distracted by his feared fate, hands cash to the boys to take five female officers out on the town.  The boys are interrupted in their romantic adventure by Frisbee, who sends them off crawling, stumbling and weaving their way through an Army obstacle course. The five female officers are left waiting, incensed that they have been stood up by privates. Later that night the exhausted boys are assigned sentry duty and accidentally enable the two spies to take Louie at gunpoint. However, within minutes the boys realize the predicament when they remember Louie's last words, \"routine 11,\" are a code for kidnapping. The boys jump in a jeep, drive off the grounds and, after unsuccessfully grilling a talking donkey about the whereabouts of their friend, stumble upon the spies's hideout and surprise them while they are trying to slap the formula out of Louie. Marsha arrives soon after and Sach, having been left alone guarding the captured spies, hands the gun to Marsha so he can join the others.  When the boys return to the room, the spies threaten to pick them off one by one if Louie does not reveal the secret formula. After Louie calls out for a \"routine 6,\" antics ensue and two vases come crashing down, knocking the spies out.  Upon their heroic return to camp with spies in tow, the boys are awarded medals for acting way \"beyond the call of duty.\" However, as the boys had to go AWOL in order to save Louie, Frisbee marches them straight back into the \"clink.\"<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "New York's Bowery Boys--Slip Mahoney, Sach, Bobby, Whitey and Chuck--decide to sell their dilapidated car for enough money to save Louie's malt shop.  They park the car in front of a bank, theorizing that people using the bank's facilities will have money to spend, but the only person who shows any interest is a street cleaner.  When the boys' efforts are unsuccessful, Slip resolves to take out a loan.  Before they enter the bank, however, they encounter their friend, sidewalk photographer Cathy Smith, and Sach asks her to take his picture.  Just as she snaps his photograph, three robbers run out of a bank.  Later, when Slip learns there is a reward for the capture of the robbers, he believes that the photograph that Cathy took might include a picture of the men.  When he asks Cathy about the photograph, however, she explains that she has already turned her camera in to her employer.  With Cathy's help, the boys break into the photo laboratory, just as one of Professor Schrackenberger's inventions causes an explosion inside.  To the boys' disappointment, the only person in Cathy's photograph is Sach.  Realizing that the police might believe that Sach is one of the thieves, Slip removes the negative, intending to destroy it.  Before they can leave the laboratory, Cathy and the boys are confronted by policeman O'Malley and Cathy's boss, Mr. Johnson, who have come to investigate the explosion.  Johnson fires Cathy and chases the boys away. In the confusion, Slip loses Sach's photograph, and later, it shows up on the front page of the newspaper.  Gangster Ace Deuce, who actually engineered the hold-up with Feather-Fingers, spreads the rumor that Sach was working for a rival gang.  While the police and Deuce's men search for Sach, who is hiding in Cathy's apartment, the rest of the boys try to discover the identity of the real bank robbers. By accident, they learn that the robbers are working for Deuce, and Slip devises a plan to force Deuce to implicate himself. Impersonating the head of the rival gang, Slip successfully carries out his plan, and Cathy takes a photograph as evidence, but on their way out of Deuce's nightclub, they are recognized by the street cleaner, who was really Deuce's lookout during the bank robbery.  Deuce sends his henchman, Moose McCall, after the boys.  At the laboratory, where Cathy and the boys are developing her photograph, Moose drinks one of the professor's concoctions. When the professor declares that Moose is now a human bomb, Slip agrees to take him to a hospital if he will testify against Deuce.  After some confusion, the police arrest the gang. The boys give the reward money to Louie, and Cathy's photograph of Deuce earns her a newspaper job.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Barlow has traveled 3,000 miles to arrest Louie for the twenty-year-old murder of Pete Briggs, his partner in a gold mine.  After Barlow leaves, Louie explains to the boys and to their leader, Slip Mahoney, that he was framed by saloon owner Blackjack, who killed Pete for the gold, but never found it.  The map to the treasure, which he hopes to restore to Pete's daughter Kathryn, is painted on Louie's back.  Slip sends his friend Gabe, a cardsharp, to Hangman's Hollow to acquaint himself with Blackjack, and Slip and the boys--Whitey, Chuck, Bobby and Sach--follow Gabe after painting a copy of the map on Sach's back. As they near Hangman's Hollow, they are met by a band of Indians, who are dressed in war regalia for their annual heritage celebration. Sach shows the map to Joe, one of the Indians, and Indian Joe reports to Blackjack, who in turn orders his men to shoot at the boys when they arrive in town.  The local marshal is Kate T. Barlow, Luke's wife, who lives with Carolyn Briggs, a performing sharpshooter at Blackjack's saloon.  Slip and the boys tell Kate they are looking for a baby named Kathryn Briggs, and show her a photograph of an infant that Louie had given them, which matches one in her scrapbook.  While sleeping outdoors, Sach is taken hostage by Indian Joe and brought to Blackjack. Enroute, however, they go through a pond, and the map is washed off. In Blackjack's Plugged Dollar Saloon, Gabe introduces Slip to Blackjack as sharpshooting outlaw \"Dead Eye\" Dan McGurke, and Slip fools Blackjack into believing he is a perfect shot by apparently hitting the center of an ace of spades, which Carolyn has actually shot. After Carolyn performs in the saloon, she matches her childhood photo with Slip's, and he realizes she is Pete's grown daughter.  Sach, meanwhile, has told Blackjack that there is another map, and, thinking it is on the back of one of the boys, Blackjack's men stage a hoedown in which they try to pull off the boys's shirts.  Slip holds up Blackjack and brings him to the Barlow ranch.  By stringing him up in a bull pen, Slip and the boys force Blackjack to confess to murdering Pete and framing Louie.  Louie arrives with Luke for his hanging, but is exonerated, and Sach follows with Blackjack's men as his captives.  Back in Louie's Sweet Shop, Sach tells Louie, Slip and the boys about his Western dream.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Bowery to Bagdad",
"Storyline": "During the reign of Hamud, the Caliph of Bagdad, after the magic lamp once belonging to Aladdin is stolen, Hamud orders his men to return it to him at any cost. The lamp is not recovered during Hamud's lifetime, but because his orders are sacred, future generations of his retainers continue the search until finally, in the 1950s, Selim and Abdul travel to the Bowery in New York City.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, bumbling Horace DeBussy \"Sach\" Jones buys the lamp at a junk shop and intends to give it to his pal, Louie Dumbrowski, the owner of the sweet shop in which Sach works. When Sach shows his treasure to his \"chief,\" Terence Aloysius \"Slip\" Mahoney, and two other pals, Chuck and Butch, Slip ridicules him for wasting his money. While they are squabbling, Tiny and Canarsie, henchmen of racketeer Duke Dolan, arrive to pressure Louie to surrender his lease to the shop, but Louie adamantly refuses. In the shop's back room, Sach grumbles about his lack of courage and Slip's constant nagging, then, when he polishes the lamp, is amazed by the sudden appearance of the wish-granting genie of the lamp. The genie is equally amazed by Sach's stupidity, but nonetheless grants his wish for six malteds. While Sach enjoys his treats, the entire affair is witnessed by Tiny, who rushes to Duke's penthouse to tell him about the magical occurrence. Duke's third hood, Gus, has recently read about the lamp and convinces Duke that it is worth pursuing, so Duke sends Tiny and Canarsie to steal it.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sach tells Slip about his discovery, but Slip does not believe him until Sach makes the genie appear again. The conniving Slip persuades Sach to share the lamp with him, then instructs the genie that he can only take orders from the two of them jointly. The boys request $1,000,000, but are surprised when the genie loads the table with gold bars rather than \"folding money.\" During the boys's ensuing quarrel, Sach inadvertantly wishes the gold away and both the money and the genie disappear. The incident is witnessed by Abdul and Selim, who follow Tiny and Canarsie after they steal the lamp.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the penthouse, Duke's girl friend Velma urges him to rub the lamp, but when the genie appears, the gangsters are angered to learn that he cannot take their orders. Believing Sach to be the genie's master, Duke sends Velma to the sweet shop, where she flirts outrageously with the dumbfounded Sach, and lures him and Slip to the penthouse. Gus's girl friend Claire pretends to be Velma's cousin and attempts to romance Slip while Velma separates him from Sach. Velma takes Sach to Duke, who threatens him with physical violence if he does not persuade the genie to obey them. The genie finally explains that he can only take orders from Slip and Sach together, so while Velma holds Sach at gun point, the gangsters search for Slip, who has escaped from Claire and Gus.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSelim and Abdul have also arrived at the huge penthouse, adding to the melée. The Arabs capture Slip and lock him in the pantry, while the genie urges Sach to escape from Velma by aggressively romancing her. Louie, Chuck and Butch, who were told by Slip to come if he had not returned by 10:00, enter the fray, and after Slip is snatched from the pantry by Gus and Canarsie, Louie winds up in the pantry getting drunk with the genie. Duke, who keeps getting accidentally hit on the head by his men, becomes disgusted, and when Slip and Sach wander out onto the window ledge, orders his men to shoot them. Fortunately for the boys, Sach has found the lamp, and together they ask the genie to take them home.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey are momentarily baffled upon realizing that they have been transported to ancient Bagdad, the genie's home, but when a group of lovely harem girls come to pamper them, they decide to linger for a while. Their enjoyment is interrupted by the arrival of the caliph, who orders the genie to return to him and threatens to chop the boys into pieces when the genie states that he cannot. Slip reluctantly offers to exchange the genie for their freedom, and after the caliph agrees, the genie sends the boys back to the New York window ledge, where they are still under fire from the gangsters. Just then, Chuck and Butch arrive with the police, and Duke and his hoods are arrested. Later, at the shop, Slip and the boys are bemoaning their fate when the genie, who has become fond of them, pops up to grant them one last wish. Although Slip urges caution so that they do not waste their wish, Sach, fed up with Slip's insults, inadvertantly wishes that he had the nerve to punch Slip. His wish granted, Sach knocks Slip unconscious, but then quickly runs out the door before Slip can awaken and take revenge.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "During a storm in New York City, Horace Debussy \"Sach\" Jones pretends he is an aviator while aboard a mounted children's airplane ride in his friend Louie's sweets shop.  When Sach's best friend, Slip Mahoney, makes fun of him, Sach proudly displays his paperwork for a flying school correspondence course. While they are talking, former neighbor Dave Moreno, now a captain with the U.S. Air Force, arrives for a visit.  Dave reveals that he works as a researcher on a secret rocket project.  The next day, Sach, Slip and their friends Chuck and Butch, who are all known as The Bowery Boys, read that Dave has been arrested as a spy by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for selling military secrets.  Convinced of Dave's innocence, Sach and Slip try to visit him at the Allen Air Force base and unwittingly complete recruitment papers.  Despite numerous lengthy tests, Sach and Slip do not comprehend their error until they are inducted into the Air Force.  The commanding officer, Col. Davenport, then assigns them to ground crew school.  When Sach is mistakenly assigned to sleep in the barracks of the Women's Air Force, female Sgt. Anderson attempts to have him reassigned.  Sach must stay, however, as the officer who signed his orders is unavailable.  Sach is given sleeping quarters in the laundry room, which he disrupts due to his clumsiness and must then spend the night re-washing the laundry.  Slip, meanwhile, runs afoul of his barracks sergeant, Brodsky, who is accidentally knocked out by a fire extinguisher because of Slip's antics. The next day, Slip and Sach attempt to visit Dave but are refused entry because they do not have a pass.  They then go to the Post Exchange store and are surprised to see Louie, Chuck and Butch, who have come to visit.  When waitress Dorene Thompson overhears their conversation about Dave, she privately convinces Sach to bring her news of him as he is her friend.  That night, Sach causes pandemonium in the women's barracks when he sneaks in to find Slip.  Sach and Slip sneak out when the lights are doused and climb a ladder up to Dave's quarters to free their friend.  However, Dave refuses to attempt an escape, and Sach and Slip are arrested by military police.  Unknown to them, Dave is released and secretly meets with Davenport and FBI agents, with whom he is working undercover to expose a spy network. Dave agrees to continue to work to foil the spies, and Davenport agrees to release the unsuspecting Slip and Sach as well. Dorene, who is working with the spies, learns that Dave is out of prison and orders her cohorts to contact him at a public air show at the base.  That day, Sach and Slip mistake two men tailing Dave for thugs.  They assault the men and trap them in the supply barracks, unaware that they are actually FBI agents following Dave for his own safety.  The boys then follow Dave themselves, and when he is kidnapped by Dorene and her cohorts, they send Butch, Chuck and Louie to get help.  Sach, who received his airman's certificate while in jail, then convinces Slip to join him aboard a plane in order to follow the spies.  He is unaware, however, that the plane is being radio-controlled and is featured in the air show.  After the plane takes off, it is shot at by Air Force fighter planes as part of a demonstration.  A terrified Sach consults his flight manual, but each chapter is titled \"How to Face Death in the Air.\"  He finally locates operating instructions and regains control of the plane, much to the surprise of the radio operator on the ground.  Sach manages to land safely in a field, which coincidentally, is near a farmhouse where Dave is being tortured to reveal military secrets. Sach and Slip burst into the house and assault the spies, whom they subdue after a lengthy fight.  When Dorene attempts to hold them at gunpoint, Sach pulls a rug out from underneath her and she, too, is taken hostage.  Davenport, who had been alerted by Chuck and Butch, arrives shortly afterward to find that Slip has injected the spies with truth serum they intended to use on Dave.  The spies are arrested following their confessions, and Davenport congratulates Sach on his excellent flying skills.  After Sach accidentally sits on the truth serum syringe, he admits his flying skills were nothing but dumb luck.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "After some children playing in the street break a window of Louie's sweetshop with their baseball, Slip and Sach decide to rent a nearby vacant lot in which the children can play. The property is owned by the Gravesends, who invite the Boys to their mansion to discuss the arrangement. Unknown to Slip and Sach, the family - - two brothers, Derek and Anton, sister Amelia and niece Francine - - are all quite mad. Derek requires a human brain to transplant into his gorilla, Cosmos, while Anton needs a head for his robot Gorog. Amelia seeks food for her man-eating tree and Francine, a vampire, is always on the lookout for new blood. All the Gravesends consider that Slip and Sach qualify as donors for their particular experiments, prompting  Derek to invite them to stay the night, stating that he will discuss the rental of the lot with his lawyer in the morning. After Grissom, the butler, is temporarily transformed into a monster when he drinks a potion Anton has created, Derek prepares Cosmos to receive Sach's brain. While demonstrating to Derek that he can control Gorog by sending the robot directions over a microphone, Anton accidentally sends the robot to kill Sach in the guest bedroom. Luckily for Sach, Anton rescinds the order before Gorog can do any damage. Meanwhile, Louie, becoming concerned that Slip and Sach have not returned, sets off with Chuck and Butch to find them. In the morning, at gunpoint, Derek informs Slip and Sach that due to the operations they are about to undergo, they will be the forerunners of a new, happy race, unburdened by intelligence. Alerted that Louie and the others are at the front door, Derek locks Slip and Sach in a closet, from which they attempt to escape by breaking through the wall, but discover that Cosmos' cage is on the other side. After Derek takes Louie and the others prisoner, he and Anton prepare Slip and Sach for their respective operations. Cosmos gets loose, however, and knocks out Grissom and Anton, then frees Slip who inadvertently activates Gorog, telling it to attack Cosmos. Slip then tries to escape, but is cornered by Amelia who wants to feed him to her tree. Slip is then freed by Francine so that he can become a blood donor. Sach escapes only to be chased by both Cosmos and Gorog and is eventually caught by Grissom, who takes him to the laboratory where Derek and Anton fight over who will use Sach in their transplant. Meanwhile, Slip has found Louie and the others and gains control of Gorog, sending it to attack Grissom and the brothers. After Anton destroys the robot's controlling mechanism, they recapture Sach, who drinks some of Anton's potion, turns into a monster and defeats them all. The effects of the potion wear off just as Sach is about to strangle Slip. Slip then secures Derek's signature for the use of the lot. However, back in the Bowery, Louie's windows continue to be broken, thanks to the addition to the team of a powerful home-run hitter, Gorog.<BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Crashing Las Vegas",
"Storyline": "When New York boardinghouse landlady Mrs. Kate Kelly is given her notice after more than thirty years, her tenants and friends, Slip Mahoney and Sach Jones, determine to help her buy the building, even though they are broke.  Just after the bumbling Sach gets a strong shock from an electric plug, their friends Butch and Chuck arrive with four free tickets to the \"Live Like a King\" quiz program.  Hoping to get a chance to win some money, the boys go to the show that afternoon.  Winners are determined by a spin of a wheel of fortune, and Sach, who has been seeing numbers in his head since the shock, accurately predicts what the first several winning seat numbers will be.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nBy bullying another member of the audience into vacating seat number 87, Slip wins the prize when that number is called. Slip's three friends demand to share the prize, so Slip convinces the program emcee to change the prize from four luxurious weeks in Las Vegas for one to one week for four.  After being flown to Las Vegas and checking into their hotel, Sach decides to bet a quarter on the roulette wheel.  He repeatedly wins, amassing a large amount of money, but loses it all after stepping away from the table. Slip then gives him another quarter, and Sach wins even more money, attracting the attention of fortune hunter Carol LaRue and her two cohorts, Oggy and Sam, who think Sach has a system and want to find out what it is.  The next day, Sach introduces his friends to Carol, who relates that Sach saved her life in the swimming pool. \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nWhen Carol tells Sach that she came to Las Vegas to win money for her mother's operation, he boasts that he can help her but loses her last two hundred dollars when he fails to predict the winning numbers on the roulette wheel.  After she angrily leaves him in the casino, Sach confesses to Slip that when she was with him, he could not think of anything but her, then quickly wins enough money to close down the wheel.  Later, Carol, Oggy and Sam determine to cheat Sach out of his winnings and devise a plan that involves another cohort, Tony.  Next morning, Carol calls Sach and apologizes, asking to see him again.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nAt breakfast, Slip says that they now have enough money for Mrs. Kelly but suggests that Sach try some of the other casinos to win something for their \"reclining\" years.  Because a picture of Sach and a story about his luck appears in the morning newspaper, though, they realize that no other casino will let him gamble and decide to go home after a night out on the town.  When Carol meets Sach at one of the clubs that night, she convinces him to sneak off with her.  When Slip, Butch and Chuck later go looking for Sach, they find a recording device that Tony has planted in his room and assume that Sach has been kidnapped.  While they call the police to report Sach's disappearance, Carol takes Sach to her \"penthouse\" apartment.  Unknown to the naïve Sach, Tony, Sam and Oggy trick him into believing he is riding the elevator to the twenty-first floor, when, in fact, they never leave the first floor.  Once inside Carol's apartment, she makes a play for him until Tony, who she says is her husband, angrily bursts through the door.  Tony then scuffles with Sach and leaps out the open window, making Sach think that he is responsible for Tony's death.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nNow Oggy, who accompanied Tony, pretends to call the police to a report a murder, but Sach rushes out of the room, gets into the elevator and exits after what he thinks is 21 floors.  Outside, he sees Tony's \"body\" on the ground then hides in a nearby car, not knowing that it is a police car.  When Sach hears a radio report that the police are looking for him, he mistakenly believes that they want him for the murder of Carol's husband.  He then makes his way back to his own hotel room and hides in the closet when he hears his three friends come in.  Overhearing Slip talk to the police using the words \"murder\" and \"conviction,\" Sach, still convinced that that he is a fugitive, faints.  While unconscious, he dreams that the hotel floor manager is a judge who sentences Sach, Slip, Butch and Chuck to execution in the electric chair.  As Sach starts to scream in his sleep, the boys overhear him and open the door.  After Slip and Sach exchange stories, Slip guesses that the \"murder\" was a setup and goes to find a lawyer.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nAfter he leaves, Carol and Oggy arrive and suggest to Sach that they could make a deal if he tells them what his system is.  Although they do not believe him when he says he does not have one, they leave when he offers them his suitcase full of money.  Moments later, Slip returns and when Sach explains what happened to the money, Slip reveals that the police have confirmed that there has been no murder.  To get Sach's money back, the boys all go to Carol's apartment, which they learn is on the first floor, and search the premises.  As they are searching the bedroom, Oggy and his cohorts arrive with the suitacse. A fight ensues after Sach sees Tony and realizes that he did not kill anyone.  Soon all three thugs are knocked out, as is Sach, who awakens and accidentally turns on a fan that blows all of the money out of Carol's window.  When he tries to unplug the fan, Sach gets another electric shock that makes him lose his ability to visualize numbers.  Back at their hotel, the disheartened Sach and Slip are cheered by a call from Mrs. Kelly, who has come to look after them, but wind up in a fight when Sach incorrectly guesses her room number.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

When they are finally admitted to his room, they learn that despite his melodramatic talk of having been at death's door, Sach has merely had his tonsils removed.  Later, at Louie's sweet shop, Louie gripes about having paid Sach's medical bills, and Slip promises to repay him.  While Slip and the boys are discussing ways to raise some money without actually resorting to work, a melodious singing voice is heard from across the room, and everyone is stunned to discover that it is emanating from Sach.  Slip concludes that the operation has altered Sach's voice and immediately begins to plan his friend's singing career.  He takes Sach across the street to Rick Martin's elegant Rio Cabana nightclub, where Rick's girl friend, Lola Stanton, sings, but Rick throws them out. Undeterred, Slip tells their friend, music promoter Gabe Moreno, about Sach's new talent, and the whole gang heads to the local music store, where Slip's girl friend, Sally Dolan, works.  A crowd assembles as Sach sings, and Slip and Gabe convince Louie to convert his sweet shop to a nightclub.  When Louie's Bowery Palace opens, Sach, now known as the \"Bowery Thrush,\" is a huge success, and Rick's club gradually loses all its business. Rick and Lola take in Louie's midnight show, which includes a tap dancing number by Sally, and when Slip rejects his offer to hire Sach, Rick resolves to defeat his competition through less honest means.  He sends three thugs over to Louie's to disrupt the show, but when they are trounced by Sach's devoted female fans, Rick decides to play his trump card. The next day, Lola rescues Sach from a horde of over-eager young fans and persuades him to come home with her and autograph her lamp shade.  Hours later, Sach has written his name on everything in Lola's apartment, including a paper that turns out to be a contract to sing at Rick's club. Rick shows up the next day to claim his new star, and following a disastrous night, in which Slip and the boys attempt to entertain their few remaining customers, the Bowery Palace closes.  Sach is lonely and miserable in his new job, and even having Slip swat him with his hat for old times' sake fails to cheer him up.  Meanwhile, Rick visits Sally at the music store and offers her a job, but she turns him down.  Later, however, she shows up at his apartment, having left an anonymous note telling Lola to come to Rick's apartment for a surprise.  After Lola walks in and finds Rick kissing Sally, she angrily goes to see Slip and helps him get Sach back by pointing out that the contract is made out to her.  Louie's club reopens, but as Sach approaches the microphone, he finds that his mellow singing voice has disappeared. Slip and Gabe hustle Sach off stage, and Sach reveals that his family doctor performed a procedure to get rid of a tickle in his throat.  Slip takes off his hat and proceeds to give Sach the swatting of his life.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Crazy Over Horses",
"Storyline": "When they learn stable owner Flynn owes their friend, soda shop owner Louie Dumbrowsky,  $250, the Bowery Boys gang--Slip Mahoney, Sach, Whitey, Butch and Chuck--offer to collect the two-year-old debt. At Sunnybrook Hunting and Riding Club, the mild-mannered Flynn explains that business is bad and he cannot pay, while Flynn's attractive daughter Terry, who is grooming a racehorse outside, distracts the gang. Flynn prevails upon them to accept \"my girl,\" as payment for the debt, describing her as fit, sound and pretty. The gang assumes Flynn is trading his daughter, but when they go outside to look at the merchandise, Flynn introduces them to Terry and the racehorse, My Girl, clearing up the confusion. Doc, who is responsible for the horse, has not paid room and board for My Girl in six months and it is Flynn's legal right to sell her. The boys accept the deal and Sach rides \"My Girl\" to the soda shop, where Louie is perturbed about the gang returning with a horse instead of money. Back at the riding club, gangster Weepin' Willie arrives to collect My Girl, and Flynn gives him Louie's address. At the racetrack Willie informs Duke, the horseracing racket leader, that Doc, his employee, took off with the board money and My Girl has been sold to Louie to pay off the debt. Duke's plan is to replace Tarzana, who has just finished last in a race and has suffered a series of losses, with look-a-like horse My Girl, a sure bet at 20 to 1 odds. Duke, Willie and henchman Swifty go to the soda shop and offer $500 for the horse, but when Slip finds out that they are willing to pay up to $1,000, he concludes the horse is a \"gimmick\" in a racehorse racket and refuses to sell. Later that night after the boys have left, Willie knocks at the soda shop door and distracts Louie while Duke and Swifty exchange Tarzana for My Girl. Later at his office Duke calls J. T. Randal, whose large bet rides on the My Girl ruse, telling him the \"trouble\" has been straightened out. The next morning the boys arrive back at the shop and find that the normally even-tempered My Girl has left the backroom in a shambles, and, she even attacks Sach, who had earlier befriended her. The gang takes the horse to Sunnybrook, and Terry and Flynn ascertain that, though she has the same markings, the horse is not My Girl, as she refuses to do Terry's handkerchief trick. Back at the shop Louie tells the gang about Willie's suspicious behavior the previous evening, and Slip assumes the horses have been switched and decides to switch them back. When the gang brings Tarzana to the racetrack stables, and are about to make the switch, however, a police officer approaches. Sach and Whitey distract him, but the horses switch places in the stall and Sach takes Tarzana by mistake. Back at Flynn's, the handkerchief trick fails again and Slip is furious and kicks Sach out of the gang. The gang then drives to the racetrack stables and makes the switch, returning later to the riding club, where Terry confirms that they have the correct horse. Slip decides to run My Girl in the same race as Tarzana, thinking she will win. The gang leaves for the shop, and Sach, unaware that the switch has already taken place, decides he will prove his worth to the gang by making the switch himself. Wearing blackface, he takes My Girl to the racetrack stables and approaches the black groom who is walking Tarzana. While distracting him with antics, Sach switches the horses, bringing Tarzana back to the riding club. When the boys arrive back at the stable with Louie, Sach proudly announces his accomplishment, and Slip decides the only way to keep Sach out of trouble is to allow him back in the gang. That night the gang has secured the fee and the stall, but still need the right horse. Sach finds Willie, and following a plan devised by Slip, secretly admits that the gang switched horses, forcing Willie to go back to Duke and tell him they need to switch again. After dark, Duke, Willie and Swifty make the switch back. The next day My Girl wins the race in a photo finish with coaxing from her jockey, Sach. Duke tries to make a quick exit from town, but he and Randal are caught by the police and are taken away. Later at the soda shop, Louie throws a party for the heroes. Slip thanks Sach for his help and Sach returns the gratitude with a cream pie in Slip's face.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Babes in Toyland",
"Storyline": "In the village of Toyland, evil old Silas Barnaby threatens to evict the Widow Peep, who lives in a shoe, unless she allows him to marry her daughter Bo-Peep.  The widow refuses his demand, much to the relief of Bo-Peep, who is in love with handsome Tom-Tom Piper.  Desperate for money to pay off her mortgage, Widow Peep asks for help from her well-meaning but simple lodgers, Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, who assure her that they can borrow the money from their employer, the Toymaker.  After they arrive at work, however, their hopes for a loan are dashed when it is discovered that they made a mistake in an order for Santa Claus.  Instead of the 600 one-foot tall toy soldiers that Santa needs, the boys told the toymakers to build 100 six-foot tall soldiers. The enraged Toymaker fires them and they return home just as Barnaby is again threatening Bo-Peep and her mother.  Unable to pay Barnaby, the boys resolve to obtain the deed to the shoe, and so, that night, Ollie hides in a box that Stannie takes to Barnaby as a Christmas present.  The boys intend to steal the deed while Barnaby sleeps, but he discovers their ruse, and the next day, Old King Cole proclaims that the would-be thieves are to be ducked in the pond and permanently banished to Bogeyland.  Ollie's dignity is dampened by the ducking, but he and Stannie are saved from banishment by Bo-Peep, who agrees to marry Barnaby if he drops the charges and allows her mother to move back into the shoe.  Soon after, Bo-Peep and her mother are sadly waiting with Stannie and Ollie for the wedding ceremony to begin. As Ollie laments having to give Bo-Peep away, Widow Peep goes to Barnaby's house to plead for mercy, which he refuses to give. Ollie then arrives with the bride, who is demurely covered with a heavy veil, and the wedding commences.  After the ceremony, Barnaby gives the deed to Ollie, who tears it up, but when Barnaby lifts the veil to kiss his bride, he finds Stannie, not Bo-Peep.  Barnaby vows revenge, and later that night, kidnaps Elmer, one of the Three Little Pigs, and plants evidence to make Tom-Tom appear guilty.  The next day, during Tom-Tom's trial, Stannie and Ollie find Elmer in Barnaby's cellar, but by the time they bring him back, Tom-Tom has already been sent to Bogeyland. Bo-Peep rushes off to find her sweetheart, while the townspeople chase Barnaby, who goes to Bogeyland through a secret passageway in his well.  Stannie and Ollie follow him and find Bo-Peep and Tom-Tom, then are chased back to Toyland by Barnaby and the monstrous bogeymen whom he controls.  Back at Toyland, everyone welcomes the returned heroes, but chaos breaks out as the village is overrun by Barnaby's mauraders. A resourceful mouse takes to the air in a toy blimp and drops miniature torpedoes on the bogeymen, while Stannie and Ollie start up the giant wooden soldiers. The soldiers march out of the toy factory and soon rout the bogeymen. Stannie and Ollie attempt to shoot a parting volley of darts at the fleeing monsters, but the cannon tips over and covers Ollie's backside with darts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The Day the Earth Stood Still",
"Storyline": "One morning, in July 1951, people around the world are astonished by the appearance of an unidentified, fast-moving object circling the globe.  The object, a large, metallic saucer, lands on the Mall in Washington, D.C., where a crowd quickly gathers.  Soldiers surround the saucer, and tension grows until a helmeted man emerges, telling the crowd that he has come in peace.  A nervous soldier shoots the man when he brandishes a small object, and people run in terror as an enormous robot lumbers out of the saucer.  The robot, Gort, emits a mysterious ray that melts the soldiers' weapons until the wounded alien, Klaatu, orders him to desist and informs the soldiers that the object was a gift for their president.  Klaatu is then rushed to Walter Reed Hospital, where presidential secretary Harley learns that he has traveled over 250,000,000 miles in five months.  Klaatu reveals that he must talk to all of Earth's leaders, but Harley explains that due to the unstable political climate, not all of the leaders will consent to meet with one another.  Klaatu insists that his mission is too important to be derailed by petty squabbles, and warns Harley that the future of the planet is at stake. \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe next day, doctors find that Klaatu has recovered from his wound, after which Harley returns with news that although the president has invited the world's leaders to meet, many have refused unless they can host the gathering. Bemused by their childish jealousies, Klaatu decides to learn more about the species he is visiting, and escapes from the hospital.  Radio and television broadcasts announce Klaatu's escape, but no pictures of him are available. Using the name Carpenter, Klaatu obtains a room in the boardinghouse of Mrs. Crockett, which is also inhabited by Mr. and Mrs. George Barley, Mr. Krull and an attractive widow, Helen Benson, and her young son Bobby.  The next day, Helen and her beau, Tom Stevens, go on a picnic, and Klaatu babysits Bobby, who takes him on a tour of the city.  Klaatu is impressed with the Lincoln Memorial, and when he asks Bobby who the greatest man alive is, the boy replies that famed scientist Jacob Barnhardt is the one Klaatu seeks.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nAfter taking Bobby to visit the saucer, Klaatu goes with him to Barnhardt's house, where he easily solves a math problem begun by the absent Barnhardt.  That night, Helen watches as a government agent picks up Klaatu at the boardinghouse.  Klaatu is taken to see Barnhardt, who is thrilled to learn that he is the alien.  Klaatu explains that because Earth's people are reaching a technological level at which they could be a danger to other planets, he has been sent to warn them of the consequences of their violence.  Barnhardt speculates that no one will take his message seriously unless he can prove his superior capabilities, so Klaatu promises to arrange a demonstration in two days.  The next evening, Tom belittles Klaatu's involvement with Helen and Bobby, although Bobby states that Klaatu is his best friend.  After Helen and Tom leave, Bobby follows Klaatu as he goes to the saucer, where he signals to Gort and obtains entrance to the vessel.  Inside, Klaatu arranges his demonstration, while Bobby runs home. When Helen and Tom return, Bobby tells them of his adventure, but they dismiss it as a bad dream.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nTom grows worried though, when he snoops in Klaatu's room and finds one of the diamonds that Klaatu trades for currency.  The following day, Klaatu gets Helen from her office, and when they enter the building's elevator, the power suddenly dies, and Klaatu reveals his identity to Helen. As he discusses his mission with her, people around the world are confused by the loss of all electricity, except to critical locations such as hospitals. Barnhardt is gleeful about the nonviolent demonstration, which he believes will ensure full attendance for his meeting that night of scientists and social leaders.  Half an hour later, when the power is restored, Helen is convinced of Klaatu's sincerity, and is determined to help him.  She is concerned about Tom, however, as he has taken the diamond to a jeweler for appraisal. \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nHelen rushes to Tom's office, where she is dismayed to learn that he is more interested in the fame and fortune that will result from betraying Klaatu than in the reason for his visit. While Tom alerts the Pentagon, Helen storms out and whisks Klaatu away from the boardinghouse just before the military arrives.  During their ride to Barnhardt's meeting, Klaatu tells Helen that if anything happens to him, she is to find Gort immediately and tell him \"Klaatu Barada Nikto\" to prevent him from destroying the Earth.  Before they can reach the ship, however, Helen and Klaatu are stopped by soldiers, and Klaatu is fatally shot. Helen escapes and goes to Gort, who responds to her repetition of Klaatu's orders by carrying her inside the saucer, then stealing Klaatu's body and returning it to the ship.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThere, Gort revives Klaatu, although Klaatu tells Helen that his re-animation will last for an uncertain duration.  Klaatu then appears before Barnhardt's colleagues and warns them that because the universe grows smaller every day, threats of aggression cannot be tolerated.  Klaatu assures them that they will not lose any freedoms, but that they will be under the watchful eye of a robot such as Gort, who was invented by an organization of planets determined to stamp out violence. Each planet is guarded by a robot that impartially acts against aggression, and the inhabitants live in peace, Klaatu states, with their energies turned toward higher goals. Klaatu informs the crowd, \"Your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration.\"  With a final smile for Helen, Klaatu then leaves with Gort.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "One morning, in July 1951, people around the world are astonished by the appearance of an unidentified, fast-moving object circling the globe.  The object, a large, metallic saucer, lands on the Mall in Washington, D.C., where a crowd quickly gathers.  Soldiers surround the saucer, and tension grows until a helmeted man emerges, telling the crowd that he has come in peace.  A nervous soldier shoots the man when he brandishes a small object, and people run in terror as an enormous robot lumbers out of the saucer.  The robot, Gort, emits a mysterious ray that melts the soldiers' weapons until the wounded alien, Klaatu, orders him to desist and informs the soldiers that the object was a gift for their president.  Klaatu is then rushed to Walter Reed Hospital, where presidential secretary Harley learns that he has traveled over 250,000,000 miles in five months.  Klaatu reveals that he must talk to all of Earth's leaders, but Harley explains that due to the unstable political climate, not all of the leaders will consent to meet with one another.  Klaatu insists that his mission is too important to be derailed by petty squabbles, and warns Harley that the future of the planet is at stake. \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe next day, doctors find that Klaatu has recovered from his wound, after which Harley returns with news that although the president has invited the world's leaders to meet, many have refused unless they can host the gathering. Bemused by their childish jealousies, Klaatu decides to learn more about the species he is visiting, and escapes from the hospital.  Radio and television broadcasts announce Klaatu's escape, but no pictures of him are available. Using the name Carpenter, Klaatu obtains a room in the boardinghouse of Mrs. Crockett, which is also inhabited by Mr. and Mrs. George Barley, Mr. Krull and an attractive widow, Helen Benson, and her young son Bobby.  The next day, Helen and her beau, Tom Stevens, go on a picnic, and Klaatu babysits Bobby, who takes him on a tour of the city.  Klaatu is impressed with the Lincoln Memorial, and when he asks Bobby who the greatest man alive is, the boy replies that famed scientist Jacob Barnhardt is the one Klaatu seeks.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nAfter taking Bobby to visit the saucer, Klaatu goes with him to Barnhardt's house, where he easily solves a math problem begun by the absent Barnhardt.  That night, Helen watches as a government agent picks up Klaatu at the boardinghouse.  Klaatu is taken to see Barnhardt, who is thrilled to learn that he is the alien.  Klaatu explains that because Earth's people are reaching a technological level at which they could be a danger to other planets, he has been sent to warn them of the consequences of their violence.  Barnhardt speculates that no one will take his message seriously unless he can prove his superior capabilities, so Klaatu promises to arrange a demonstration in two days.  The next evening, Tom belittles Klaatu's involvement with Helen and Bobby, although Bobby states that Klaatu is his best friend.  After Helen and Tom leave, Bobby follows Klaatu as he goes to the saucer, where he signals to Gort and obtains entrance to the vessel.  Inside, Klaatu arranges his demonstration, while Bobby runs home. When Helen and Tom return, Bobby tells them of his adventure, but they dismiss it as a bad dream.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nTom grows worried though, when he snoops in Klaatu's room and finds one of the diamonds that Klaatu trades for currency.  The following day, Klaatu gets Helen from her office, and when they enter the building's elevator, the power suddenly dies, and Klaatu reveals his identity to Helen. As he discusses his mission with her, people around the world are confused by the loss of all electricity, except to critical locations such as hospitals. Barnhardt is gleeful about the nonviolent demonstration, which he believes will ensure full attendance for his meeting that night of scientists and social leaders.  Half an hour later, when the power is restored, Helen is convinced of Klaatu's sincerity, and is determined to help him.  She is concerned about Tom, however, as he has taken the diamond to a jeweler for appraisal. \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nHelen rushes to Tom's office, where she is dismayed to learn that he is more interested in the fame and fortune that will result from betraying Klaatu than in the reason for his visit. While Tom alerts the Pentagon, Helen storms out and whisks Klaatu away from the boardinghouse just before the military arrives.  During their ride to Barnhardt's meeting, Klaatu tells Helen that if anything happens to him, she is to find Gort immediately and tell him \"Klaatu Barada Nikto\" to prevent him from destroying the Earth.  Before they can reach the ship, however, Helen and Klaatu are stopped by soldiers, and Klaatu is fatally shot. Helen escapes and goes to Gort, who responds to her repetition of Klaatu's orders by carrying her inside the saucer, then stealing Klaatu's body and returning it to the ship.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThere, Gort revives Klaatu, although Klaatu tells Helen that his re-animation will last for an uncertain duration.  Klaatu then appears before Barnhardt's colleagues and warns them that because the universe grows smaller every day, threats of aggression cannot be tolerated.  Klaatu assures them that they will not lose any freedoms, but that they will be under the watchful eye of a robot such as Gort, who was invented by an organization of planets determined to stamp out violence. Each planet is guarded by a robot that impartially acts against aggression, and the inhabitants live in peace, Klaatu states, with their energies turned toward higher goals. Klaatu informs the crowd, \"Your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration.\"  With a final smile for Helen, Klaatu then leaves with Gort.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad",
"Storyline": "After the winds throw his ship off course, Capt. Sinbad dares to drop anchor off the mysterious Island of Colossa.  In the morning, Sinbad leads his fiancée, Princess Parisa; Harufa, his second-in-command; and the rest of his crew to the island where they find giant cloven footprints in the sand.  As they approach a cave fronted by a massive stone mask, a one-eyed monster known as a Cyclops chases the magician Sokurah out of the mouth of the cave.  When the Cyclops attacks Sinbad and his crew, Sokurah summons The Genie from his magic lamp and orders him to erect a barrier to protect them.  Unable to penetrate the barrier, the Cyclops angrily watches as the men row away in their boat, then hurls a boulder over the barrier.  The resulting wave capsizes the boat, spilling its occupants and the lamp into the water.  As Sinbad and the others reach the safety of their ship, the Cyclops pulls the lamp from the sea, infuriating Sokurah, who insists upon returning to retrieve the vessel.  Sinbad refuses, stating that he is on an important mission of which peace hangs in the balance.  Upon reaching Bagdad, Sinbad is greeted by the Caliph, who regards Sinbad as his son.  In one week's time, Sinbad is to marry Parisa, the daughter of a Sultan, and thus cement peaceful relations between their countries.  When Sokurah performs at a feast on the eve of the wedding, the Sultan is so impressed that he asks the magician to prophesize the future.  The magician foretells war and disaster in Bagdad, then offers to disperse the evil powers in return for a ship and a crew to sail back to Colossa.  Furious, the Caliph banishes Sokurah from the city.  That night, while Parisa sleeps, Sokurah slips into her chambers and casts a spell that causes her to shrink.  In the morning, when Sinbad discovers his now lilliputian princess, he promises to take Sokurah to Colossa if the magician will restore his bride to normal size.  Aware that most sailors would consider the mission too dangerous, Sinbad recruits a crew from the prison yard.  As they sail the unchartered waters, the criminals plan a mutiny against Sinbad and his loyal band of followers.  Just as Sinbad hides the princess in a tiny chest to protect her, the men mutiny.  When the mutineers threaten to kill Sokurah, Sinbad surrenders, after which the rebels sentence them to die at dawn.  That night, Sokurah tells Sinbad that high winds and strong currents will drive the ship toward the island of screaming demons, and that all within earshot will be driven mad by the hideous screams.  After Sinbad and his party stuff rags in their ears to block the screams, Sokurah's prophecy comes true as the others are driven mad.  Sinbad seizes the wheel just in time to steer the ship safely through the reef and back to the island of Colossa.  As they set up an immense crossbow with which to slay the Cyclops, Sokurah suggests the group split into two for the perilous trek across the Valley of the Cyclops.  Sinbad's group finds treasure hidden in the Cyclops' cave and wants to abandon their mission and make off with the riches.  As Sinbad argues with them, a Cyclops appears, plucks up the men and tosses them into a cage.  Meanwhile, Sokurah's men gorge themselves in a pool of wine while the magician goes in search of the lamp.  When the Cyclops ties Harufa onto a spit, intending to roast him for dinner, the desperate Sinbad pulls the chest containing the princess from his pocket and asks her to open the latch at the top of the cage.  Once the princess slips the latch, Sinbad and his men climb out of the cage and free Harufa.  In the cave, Sokurah seizes the lamp and is then chased by a Cyclops. The drunken men confront the beast, who summarily crushes them.   After Sokurah and Sinbad take cover in the rocks, Sinbad thrusts his burning torch into the beast's eye, blinding it.  Sinbad then lures the Cyclops to the edge of a cliff, from which it plunges to its death.  Distrustful of Sokurah, Sinbad refuses to relinquish the lamp.  Needing a shell from an egg of the colossal two-headed Roc bird to complete the potion that will restore Parisa, Sokurah leads the remaining men up to the nesting place of the Rocs.  When two of the men find a giant egg, they hungrily crack it open and kill the squawking hatchling.  After procuring a fragment of the shell, the men head for Sokurah's cave at the edge of the Cyclops' domain.  To discover how to invoke the power of the lamp, Parisa climbs down inside to talk to the genie and discovers that the boyish genie is desperately unhappy because he longs to be free.  After the genie shows her a cryptic message about fiery rocks inscribed on the side of the lamp and tells her that his real name is Baronni, Parisa promises to help free him if he will tell her the invocation to call forth his protective powers.  Once outside the lamp, Parisa repeats the incantation to Sinbad.  At that moment, an angry Roc bird attacks and knocks the lamp out of Sinbad's hands.  As Harufa and Sokurah struggle for possession of the lamp, Sokurah kills Harufa, who tosses the lamp to Sinbad before he dies.  After the bird snatches Sinbad in his beak and drops him, unconscious, in its nest, Sokurah imprisons the princess in his cave.  Upon awakening, Sinbad summons the genie, who tells him that Parisa is being held prisoner at Sokurah's cave.  After restraining the fire-breathing dragon that guards the cave, Sinbad slips inside and orders Sokurah to restore the princess to normal size.  Although Sokurah complies, Sinbad refuses to relinquish the lamp until he reaches the safety of his ship.  Furious, Sokurah raises a skeleton from the dead and orders it to kill Sinbad.  After Sinbad vanquishes the skeleton in a duel, he flees with the princess.  Sokurah then invokes a spell to destroy the stone bridge that spans a river of fiery rock, thus blocking their escape.  The princess summons the genie, who gives them a length of rope to bridge the gap.  As they swing across the river, the princess recalls the inscription inside the lamp and casts the lamp into the river to free the genie.  When the Cyclops attacks them at the opening of the cave, Sinbad releases the dragon to combat it.  After the dragon slays the Cyclops, Sokurah goads it to kill Sinbad.  Racing to his camp, Sinbad orders his men to launch the crossbow.  Felled by the arrow, the beast collapses and crushes Sokurah.  After Sinbad and his ship sail away from Colossa, Parisa says the name \"Baronni,\" after which the genie, now transformed into a cabin boy, appears.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The 3 Worlds of Gulliver",
"Storyline": "In 1699 in the village of Wapping, England, Dr. Lemuel Gulliver, discontent with his life of poverty, decides to sign on as ship's doctor aboard the vessel piloted by Capt. Pritchard, hoping to sail the world in search of wealth and fame.  Once at sea, Gulliver discovers that his fiancée, Elizabeth Whitley, has stowed away on board.  Gulliver insists that Elizabeth be put ashore at their first port, and as the two argue, a storm-swept wave knocks Gulliver overboard.  Nearly drowned, Gulliver is washed ashore on the island of Lilliput, where his presence frightens the tiny inhabitants, who regard Gulliver as a giant.  The pompous emperor of Lilliput declares that Gulliver must be an enemy because he is different from everyone else.  To prove his benevolence, Gulliver disperses a drenching rainstorm with a puff of his breath.  As Gulliver starts building a boat so that he can set sail and find his beloved Elizabeth, he helps the Lilliputians by clearing their forests for croplands and using his hat to scoop up fish from the sea.  Gulliver envisions Lilliput as a heaven on earth until the Emperor threatens to prevent the boat from being completed unless Gulliver joins the crusade to crush the inhabitants of the nearby island of Blefscu, who have gone to war with Lilliput over their disagreement about the proper way to crack an egg.  To absolve himself from blame if the Lilliputian army is defeated, the Emperor decrees that a prime minister should be elected to lead the troops into war.  The candidates are Flimnap, the evil minister of defense, who wholeheartedly supports the annihilation of the Blefscuns, and the benevolent Reldresal, whose sweetheart Gwendolyn and her father, Lord Bermogg, are being exiled to Blefscu for cracking the wrong end of an egg.  The contest is to be decided on the basis of which candidate performs the most feats on a tightrope, and Reldresal, who shares Gulliver's dream of making Lilliput a paradise, teams with the giant to win the match.  However, when Reldresal refuses to renounce Gwendolyn, he is arrested for treason and the Emperor threatens to execute him and kill Gwendolyn unless Gulliver agrees to go to war. To save them, Gulliver swims to Blefscu, where the inhabitants are assembling an armada to attack Lilliput.  Upon reaching the harbor, Gulliver pulls up the ship's anchor lines and tows the vessels out to sea.  When Gulliver returns triumphant to Lilliput, Flimnap scoffs that you cannot win a war without suffering casualties and the Emperor, who perceives Gulliver as a threat to his power, accuses him of treason.  Warned by Reldresal that the Emperor intends to execute him, Gulliver jumps into his now completed boat and rows out to sea.  When he lands on the island of Brobdingnag, where he is terrified by a forty-foot-tall girl playing with Gulliver-sized dolls.  The girl, Glumdalclitch, scoops up Gulliver and takes him to show the King.  At the castle, Gulliver finds Elizabeth, who was washed ashore after Capt. Pritchard's boat sank.  The King beams at the tiny Elizabeth and Gulliver, whom he regards as his own special possessions, even though his sorcerer, Makovan, warns that little people are dangerous.  The King appoints Glumdalclitch as the little people's guardians and installs them in their own tiny castle.  With all their needs satisfied, Gulliver renounces his earlier quest for power and importance and marries Elizabeth.  They settle into a life of contentment until Makovan accuses Gulliver of witchcraft because of his knowledge of science, making Gulliver realize that the kingdom is backward and ignorant and that he and Elizabeth exist merely as amusements for the King.  After the Queen develops a stomachache, Gulliver formulates a medicine to cure her, confirming Makovan's suspicions.  The King, jealous of his wife's admiration for Gulliver, orders Glumdalclitch to take Gulliver to Makovan's lab, where the sorcerer plans to prove that he is a witch.   When Gulliver refuses to denounce medicine and science, Makovan deems him a witch, and the King, in turn, decides to feed him to his pet crocodile.  Using his ingenuity, Gulliver slays the creature, after which Glumdalclitch snatches up Gulliver and Elizabeth, puts them in her basket and flees the castle with the King and his courtiers in pursuit.  When Glumdalclitch stumbles and drops the basket, Gulliver and Elizabeth tumble out and run into a forest.  Unable to locate the little people, the King sets fire to the brush.  Elizabeth and Gulliver take refuge at the mouth of a stream, and when Glumdalclitch finds them there, she puts them into her basket and hurls it into the stream, which flows into the sea.  Awakening on a beach with Elizabeth, Gulliver realizes that love is the only thing that sustains life in a fearful, uncertain world.  Spotting a man walking on the beach, Gulliver asks how to reach the faraway land of Wapping, England and the man replies it is just over the hill.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Warned by Reldresal that the Emperor intends to execute him, Gulliver jumps into his now completed boat and rows out to sea.  When he lands on the island of Brobdingnag, where he is terrified by a forty-foot-tall girl playing with Gulliver-sized dolls.  The girl, Glumdalclitch, scoops up Gulliver and takes him to show the King.  At the castle, Gulliver finds Elizabeth, who was washed ashore after Capt. Pritchard's boat sank.  The King beams at the tiny Elizabeth and Gulliver, whom he regards as his own special possessions, even though his sorcerer, Makovan, warns that little people are dangerous.  The King appoints Glumdalclitch as the little people's guardians and installs them in their own tiny castle.  With all their needs satisfied, Gulliver renounces his earlier quest for power and importance and marries Elizabeth.  They settle into a life of contentment until Makovan accuses Gulliver of witchcraft because of his knowledge of science, making Gulliver realize that the kingdom is backward and ignorant and that he and Elizabeth exist merely as amusements for the King.  After the Queen develops a stomachache, Gulliver formulates a medicine to cure her, confirming Makovan's suspicions.  The King, jealous of his wife's admiration for Gulliver, orders Glumdalclitch to take Gulliver to Makovan's lab, where the sorcerer plans to prove that he is a witch.   When Gulliver refuses to denounce medicine and science, Makovan deems him a witch, and the King, in turn, decides to feed him to his pet crocodile.  Using his ingenuity, Gulliver slays the creature, after which Glumdalclitch snatches up Gulliver and Elizabeth, puts them in her basket and flees the castle with the King and his courtiers in pursuit.  When Glumdalclitch stumbles and drops the basket, Gulliver and Elizabeth tumble out and run into a forest.  Unable to locate the little people, the King sets fire to the brush.  Elizabeth and Gulliver take refuge at the mouth of a stream, and when Glumdalclitch finds them there, she puts them into her basket and hurls it into the stream, which flows into the sea.  Awakening on a beach with Elizabeth, Gulliver realizes that love is the only thing that sustains life in a fearful, uncertain world.  Spotting a man walking on the beach, Gulliver asks how to reach the faraway land of Wapping, England and the man replies it is just over the hill.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Mr. Soft Touch",
"Storyline": "At Christmas time in San Francisco, Joe Miracle steals $100,000 from the River Club, which he used to own.  After evading his pursuers, Joe hides out with Victor Christopher, the brother of his dead partner Leo, and Victor's wife Clara.  Clara has purchased a berth for Joe on the next ship leaving the city.  The ship, however, will not depart until the following night.  While Joe is trying to decide where he will hide until then, the police demand to search the apartment.  At first Joe believes they are looking for the stolen money, but learns that they want to arrest Victor for disturbing the peace and beating Clara.  When the police mistake Joe for Victor and arrest him for the night, Joe believes that his problems are solved, but Jenny Jones, a social worker, persuades the judge to give Joe a suspended sentence.  Joe then suggests that he stay at the settlement house until he can control his urge to beat Clara.  Later Joe telephones Clara and asks her to bring him the stolen money.  While Joe is hanging Christmas decorations, a group of teenagers talk him into a dice game.  Joe wins from the boys the money they were supposed to spend on a Christmas tree. Later, he secretly returns the money to Jenny's desk, leaving the boys to figure out a solution to their problem. Joe then hides the stolen money in the gym.  After the boys cut down a tree from the park, Jenny persuades the police not to press charges against them, but is angry that Joe gambled with them.  Then, when Joe accidentally falls on the piano and breaks it, she is ready to ask him to leave.  Her attitude softens a little, however, when she discovers the returned money in her desk.  Later, Joe visits a piano store that is actually a front for a bookie operation and coerces the owner into providing a free piano to replace the broken one. While at the store, Joe is spotted by newspaper columnist \"Early\" Byrd, who follows him to the settlement house and questions Jenny about him.  After the janitor finds a gun hidden in Joe's mattress, Jenny reveals that she knows Joe's real identity and asks him to leave.  When he objects, Jenny shows him her hearing aid and tells him about her abusive father, whose beatings made her deaf. Their discussion is interrupted by the delivery of new towels, sheets, blankets and several bathtubs--all arranged by Joe. Joe, who has gone to his room to pack, finds Byrd waiting for him, and from him learns that Leo was killed by the syndicate when he refused to sell the River Club while Joe was in the Army. Just before he leaves, Joe accompanies Jenny to visit some poor Polish-Americans.  He asks Jenny to leave the country with him, but before she can make a decision, the syndicate, alerted by Byrd, corners him and demands that he return the stolen money.  Although Jenny begs Joe to comply, he insists that the money is rightfully his.  The gangsters then start a fire in the settlement house and are able to retrieve the money in the confusion, but the building burns to the ground. Later, Joe sneaks into the River Club and forces Barney Teener, the boss, to replace the money taken by his friends. Then, disguised as Santa Claus, Joe donates the entire amount to the settlement house building fund.  As he leaves, Joe is shot by a gang member.  Jenny rushes to him, and both realize that after he recovers, they will spend their lives together.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Singin' in the Rain",
"Storyline": "In 1927, fans gather at Hollywood's Chinese Theatre for the premiere of Monumental Picture's latest romantic epic, <I>  The Royal Rascal  </I>, starring the popular silent screen couple Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont.  Don tells radio commentator Dora Bailey that his motto has always been \"dignity\" and relates the idyllic story of his childhood and rise to fame, all of which is complete fabrication.  The audience applauds enthusiastically at the end of the swashbuckling film and asks for speeches from its stars, whom they think are a couple off-screen as well as on, but Don, who loathes his screechy-voiced co-star, insists that Lina merely smile. Assisted by studio boss R. F. Simpson, Don slips away from the cloying Lina and drives with his best friend, studio pianist Cosmo Brown, to the premiere party.  On Hollywood Blvd., Cosmo's car breaks down, and Don is surrounded by fans.  To escape the screaming mob, who have torn his tuxedo, Don jumps onto a passing car driven by Kathy Selden. She is frightened at first, but when a policeman tells Kathy who Don is, she offers him a ride to his house in Beverly Hills. Although Kathy says that she is a stage actress, who has seen only one of Don's films, she is actually a chorus girl at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter dropping Don off to change his clothes, Kathy drives to the party at R. F.'s house, where she will be performing.  Don arrives at the party in time to see a short talking picture. Most of the guests are unimpressed by the new phenomenon, even when R. F. says that the Warner brothers are about to release a feature-length talking picture. When the entertainment starts, Don is surprised, but happy to see a scantily clad Kathy jump out of a cake, and tries to talk with her, but she thinks that he only wants to ridicule her. Just as a jealous Lina takes Don's arm, Kathy throws a cake at him, but misses, and hits Lina instead.  Kathy quickly runs away, and Don cannot find her.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSome weeks later, Warner Bros.' <I>  The Jazz Singer  </I> is a box office smash and audiences are clamoring for more talking pictures.  As Don and Lina start their next film, <I>  The Dueling Cavalier  </I>, Cosmo makes a crack about all of their films being alike, and Don is stung, thinking that Kathy was right about words being necessary for real acting. Lina continues to complain about Kathy, whom she had fired, which makes Don dislike Lina even more, as he has not seen Kathy since the party.  During a break in filming, R. F. announces that they are shutting down production and will resume in a few weeks as a talking picture.  Cosmo happily anticipates unemployment, but R. F. makes him head of the new studio music department. Some time later, when a musical number is being filmed for another picture, Cosmo sees Kathy in the chorus.  When Don shows up just as R. F. is about to offer Kathy another part, she confesses what happened at the party, but Don tells R. F. that it was not her fault and R. F. agrees.  Later, when Kathy and Don are talking, he tells her that his \"romance\" with Lina is completely fabricated by fan magazines and Kathy confesses that she has seen all of his pictures. Don has difficulty revealing his feelings to Kathy until he takes her to a romantic setting on a sound stage.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSoon preparations for <I>  The Dueling Cavalier  </I> begin with diction lessions for Lina and Don.  Although Don is fine, Lina's voice shows little improvement.  When filming resumes, director Roscoe Dexter becomes increasingly frustrated by Lina's voice and inability to speak into the microphone, but the picture is completed.  When it is previewed on a rainy night in Hollywood, the audience laughs at Lina's voice, howls at synchronization problems, and leaves the theater saying it was the worst film ever made.  Later that night, Cosmo and Kathy try to console Don, who thinks his career is over until Cosmo comes up with the idea to turn the film into a musical comedy and have Kathy dub Lina's voice.  Don worries that this plan is not good for Kathy, but she convinces him by saying it will be for just one picture.  The next day, R. F. loves the idea and they all conspire to keep Lina from finding out.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo enhance the picture, they add a modern section in which Don can sing and dance the story of a Broadway hoofer.  After the picture is finished, Don tells Kathy that he wants to tell the world how much he loves her, but as they kiss, Lina interrupts them and flies into a rage.  She then starts her own publicity campaign proclaiming herself Monumental's new singing star.  R. F. is angry, but Lina shows him her contract and he reluctantly agrees that she controls her own publicity.  Lina then threatens to ruin the studio unless Kathy continues to dub her singing and speaking voice, but do nothing else.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the picture's premiere, the audience loves \"Lina's\" voice. Feeling triumphant, Lina boasts that Kathy will keep singing for her, and Don is furious.  When the audience clamors for a song from Lina, Don hatches the idea of having Kathy stand behind a curtain and sing into a microphone as Lina pantomines the words.  While Lina silently mouths \"Singin' in the Rain,\" Don, R. F. and Cosmo pull the curtain and the audience laughs hysterically when they realize that Kathy is actually singing.  Lina does not know what is happening until Cosmo takes the microphone from Kathy and starts singing himself. Lina runs off screaming, and an embarrassed Kathy starts to leave the theater, until Don tells the audience that she is the real star of the film and has her join him in a song. Finally, a billboard proclaims that Don and Kathy are co-stars of the new Monumental film <I>  Singin' in the Rain  </I>.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Although he has never met Grizel,  Roland gruffly agrees to let her stay, and the butler explains to Grizel that Lark was Roland's father's ward.  As Grizel dresses for dinner in Lark's former room, images from the past come to life: One night, Roland's father introduces his children, Selina, Pelham and Roland, who is nicknamed \"Rollo,\" to little Lark Ingoldsby, whose parents were killed in a train accident the previous night. Dane tells his children that Lark will live with them as their sister, and Selina, who has been mistress of the house since her mother died, is immediately resentful. Back in the present, Grizel reports for duty and meets handsome Pilot Officer Pax Masterson, whose hands were burned in an airplane crash.  When she returns home later, she finds Pax waiting for her, and to her surprise, he knows all about the house and the Dane family.  Pax tells her that Lark is his aunt, and as he strikes a note on Lark's piano, another episode from the past is revealed:  Rollo comes home on leave from the service and observes that Selina treats Lark, now a pretty young woman, more imperiously than ever. Pelham gives Lark money to buy her first new dress, and introduces her to society at a party the following night. After the party, Selina informs Lark that Rollo's regiment will be sent to India for two years.  In the present, Pax finishes demonstrating his knowledge of the house for Grizel and leaves just before Roland returns.  Roland is surprised to learn that the young man he passed outside is Lark's nephew, and is dismayed to hear his practical grandniece dismiss any notion of romance on principle.  With his thoughts again turned to Lark, Roland recalls the past: Lark has become a popular young lady, and both Pelham and the wealthy Marchese Del Laudi are in love with her.  Rollo returns from India, and when he learns it is Lark's birthday, he sells his horse to buy her a beautiful necklace.  In the present, Pax recovers from the surgery on his hands, and calls on the Danes. Roland listens eagerly as Pax describes his aunt's solitary existence, soon lapsing into memories of his own: The night of Lark's birthday party, Rollo gives her the necklace, and they declare their love for each other.  Their idyll is interrupted by Selina, who informs Rollo that he has been appointed to a special mission that leaves for Afghanistan the following week.  When Rollo announces his intention to marry Lark, Selina replies that they must wait five years until Rollo returns.  Aware that she cannot remain in the house with Pelham, Lark tearfully tells Rollo she cannot wait. Later, while Rollo is seeking a release from his appointment, Selina vindictively tells Lark that he is not coming back. Rollo returns to find Lark gone, and angrily vows not to return to the house while Selena is alive.  Pelham then comes in with the news that Lark is going to marry Del Laudi and move to Italy.  In the present, as Grizel is preparing to leave on her next assignment, Pax asks her to marry him, but she declines. Roland gives the departing Pax a telegram stating that his aunt Lark is dead, then urges Grizel not to cheat herself out of love the way he did.  Although an air raid has just begun, Grizel rushes into the street, and finds Pax just as the bombs begin dropping around them.  With their arms around each other, they watch as the Dane house goes up in flames.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The Burglar",
"Storyline": "In Philadelphia, soon after burglar Nat Harbin sees a newsreel about a priceless emerald necklace owned by a spiritualist named Sister Sara, he dispatches Gladden, a woman in his gang, to case Sara's mansion.  Pretending to be an admirer of the spiritualist, Gladden gains entrance to the estate and reports back to Nat that the necklace is locked in a safe in Sara's upstairs bedroom.  Gladden continues that Sara always watches newscaster John Facenda's nightly broadcast.  The next evening, as Sara settles into her easy chair in front of the television set,  Nat scales the trellis to her bedroom and begins to drill open the safe.  While cruising by in their patrol car, two policemen notice Nat's auto parked outside the estate and stop to investigate, prompting gang members Dohmer and Baylock to signal Nat.  Scurrying back down the trellis, Nat approaches the officers and lies that his car has broken down.  After the police depart, Nat returns to the safe, removing the necklace just seconds before Sara climbs the stairs to her bedroom.  Speeding away into the night, Dohmer, Baylock and Nat drive to their hideout in a run-down tenement.  There, Baylock values the necklace at $85,000 and nervously presses Nat to sell it immediately.  After Sara reports the robbery, the officers who questioned Nat provide his description to the police artist, who then sketches an accurate drawing that is sent nationwide.  At the tenement, Dohmer leers at the shapely Gladden, angering her.  Later, Baylock questions Nat about the bond he feels to Gladden, prompting Nat to reflect back to his flight from an orphanage years earlier: The young Nat is given refuge by Gladden's father Gerald, a professional burglar who teaches the boy his trade, asking only that in return, Nat promise to take care of Gladden.  Three years later, Gerald is killed during a burglary due to Nat's blunder, and Nat has felt responsible for her ever since.  His thoughts returning to the present, Nat tells Gladden that she must go away, and the next morning, puts her on a train bound for Atlantic City.  She is followed by a shadowy man, who strikes up a friendship with her in Atlantic City.  Later, in a Philadelphia bar, Nat, depressed, meets a sultry woman named Della who invites him to her apartment.  After several drinks, Della relates the hardships she has suffered in life, ending with her husband deserting her.  Nat then tells her about Gladden and confides that he longs to leave his life of crime.  Awakening late that night in Della's apartment, Nat finds that she is missing and goes to look for her.  In the garden, he overhears her speaking to man about the necklace.  Recognizing that Gladden is in danger, Nat assembles the gang and drives to Atlantic City to protect her.  As they cross a bridge outside the city, the toll collector recognizes Nat from his drawing and notifies the authorities.  Soon after, Nat is pulled over by a policeman for a traffic violation, and when Dohmer hears a bulletin about Nat over the police radio, he shoots the officer, who fires back, killing Dohmer.  Now on the run, Baylock and Nat drive to a swamp on the edge of Atlantic City and abandon their car.  Hearing the news of the gun battle, the Philadelphia captain of police speculates that the burglars will seek refuge in Atlantic City and goes there.   At the water's edge, Nat and Baylock come across a deserted beach shack, and Nat instructs Baylock to wait there while he goes to warn Gladden.  Nat phones Gladden from the lobby of her hotel, and when she informs him she is not alone, he tells her to get rid of her boyfriend.  When the man descends the hotel stairs, Nat recognizes him as Charlie, one of the officers who questioned him on the night of the robbery.  After Nat informs Gladden that Charlie is only interested in the necklace, she upbraids Nat for his inability to perceive her as a desirable woman.  Before he leaves Gladden's room, Nat slips the necklace under her pillow and tells her where she can find him.  As Gladden removes the necklace and drops it in her music box, Charlie phones his accomplice Della in Philadelphia and orders her to come to Atlantic City.  Upon returning to the shack, Nat is confronted by an armed Charlie, who has just killed Baylock and demands the necklace.  Just as Della arrives at the shack, Nat informs Charlie that he has hidden the necklace in Gladden's room.   After instructing Della to hold Nat prisoner, Charlie goes to search for the necklace.  Taking a risk that Della will not shoot, Nat walks out of the shack and phones Gladden to warn her.  Gladden has gone out, however, and after the phone rings several times, she returns to her room and picks up the receiver, and Nat tells her to meet him at the Steel Pier. At the pier, Charlie, who has followed her, flashes his badge at a pier patrolman, then stalks Gladden and Nat into the fun house.  After Gladden drops her music box in one of the tunnels, Charlie follows the sound of the music, catching up to them at the pier's bleachers.  Soon after, the audience departs, leaving only Nat, Charlie and Gladden.  When Nat offers Charlie the necklace in exchange for Gladden's life, Charlie agrees and allows Gladden to leave.  After Nat hands Charlie the necklace, Charlie shoots him in the back, and he tumbles down the stairs where Gladden cradles the dying Nat in her arms.  Just then, the police, alerted by the patrolman, arrive and congratulate Charlie on a job well done.  Just as Charlie states that Nat threw the necklace in the ocean, Della appears and calls him a liar.  The police captain then slugs Charlie in the face, and after extracting the necklace from his pocket, handcuffs him.   \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The Burglar",
"Storyline": "In Philadelphia, soon after burglar Nat Harbin sees a newsreel about a priceless emerald necklace owned by a spiritualist named Sister Sara, he dispatches Gladden, a woman in his gang, to case Sara's mansion.  Pretending to be an admirer of the spiritualist, Gladden gains entrance to the estate and reports back to Nat that the necklace is locked in a safe in Sara's upstairs bedroom.  Gladden continues that Sara always watches newscaster John Facenda's nightly broadcast.  The next evening, as Sara settles into her easy chair in front of the television set,  Nat scales the trellis to her bedroom and begins to drill open the safe.  While cruising by in their patrol car, two policemen notice Nat's auto parked outside the estate and stop to investigate, prompting gang members Dohmer and Baylock to signal Nat.  Scurrying back down the trellis, Nat approaches the officers and lies that his car has broken down.  After the police depart, Nat returns to the safe, removing the necklace just seconds before Sara climbs the stairs to her bedroom.  Speeding away into the night, Dohmer, Baylock and Nat drive to their hideout in a run-down tenement.  There, Baylock values the necklace at $85,000 and nervously presses Nat to sell it immediately.  After Sara reports the robbery, the officers who questioned Nat provide his description to the police artist, who then sketches an accurate drawing that is sent nationwide.  At the tenement, Dohmer leers at the shapely Gladden, angering her.  Later, Baylock questions Nat about the bond he feels to Gladden, prompting Nat to reflect back to his flight from an orphanage years earlier: The young Nat is given refuge by Gladden's father Gerald, a professional burglar who teaches the boy his trade, asking only that in return, Nat promise to take care of Gladden.  Three years later, Gerald is killed during a burglary due to Nat's blunder, and Nat has felt responsible for her ever since.  His thoughts returning to the present, Nat tells Gladden that she must go away, and the next morning, puts her on a train bound for Atlantic City.  She is followed by a shadowy man, who strikes up a friendship with her in Atlantic City.  Later, in a Philadelphia bar, Nat, depressed, meets a sultry woman named Della who invites him to her apartment.  After several drinks, Della relates the hardships she has suffered in life, ending with her husband deserting her.  Nat then tells her about Gladden and confides that he longs to leave his life of crime.  Awakening late that night in Della's apartment, Nat finds that she is missing and goes to look for her.  In the garden, he overhears her speaking to man about the necklace.  Recognizing that Gladden is in danger, Nat assembles the gang and drives to Atlantic City to protect her.  As they cross a bridge outside the city, the toll collector recognizes Nat from his drawing and notifies the authorities.  Soon after, Nat is pulled over by a policeman for a traffic violation, and when Dohmer hears a bulletin about Nat over the police radio, he shoots the officer, who fires back, killing Dohmer.  Now on the run, Baylock and Nat drive to a swamp on the edge of Atlantic City and abandon their car.  Hearing the news of the gun battle, the Philadelphia captain of police speculates that the burglars will seek refuge in Atlantic City and goes there.   At the water's edge, Nat and Baylock come across a deserted beach shack, and Nat instructs Baylock to wait there while he goes to warn Gladden.  Nat phones Gladden from the lobby of her hotel, and when she informs him she is not alone, he tells her to get rid of her boyfriend.  When the man descends the hotel stairs, Nat recognizes him as Charlie, one of the officers who questioned him on the night of the robbery.  After Nat informs Gladden that Charlie is only interested in the necklace, she upbraids Nat for his inability to perceive her as a desirable woman.  Before he leaves Gladden's room, Nat slips the necklace under her pillow and tells her where she can find him.  As Gladden removes the necklace and drops it in her music box, Charlie phones his accomplice Della in Philadelphia and orders her to come to Atlantic City.  Upon returning to the shack, Nat is confronted by an armed Charlie, who has just killed Baylock and demands the necklace.  Just as Della arrives at the shack, Nat informs Charlie that he has hidden the necklace in Gladden's room.   After instructing Della to hold Nat prisoner, Charlie goes to search for the necklace.  Taking a risk that Della will not shoot, Nat walks out of the shack and phones Gladden to warn her.  Gladden has gone out, however, and after the phone rings several times, she returns to her room and picks up the receiver, and Nat tells her to meet him at the Steel Pier. At the pier, Charlie, who has followed her, flashes his badge at a pier patrolman, then stalks Gladden and Nat into the fun house.  After Gladden drops her music box in one of the tunnels, Charlie follows the sound of the music, catching up to them at the pier's bleachers.  Soon after, the audience departs, leaving only Nat, Charlie and Gladden.  When Nat offers Charlie the necklace in exchange for Gladden's life, Charlie agrees and allows Gladden to leave.  After Nat hands Charlie the necklace, Charlie shoots him in the back, and he tumbles down the stairs where Gladden cradles the dying Nat in her arms.  Just then, the police, alerted by the patrolman, arrive and congratulate Charlie on a job well done.  Just as Charlie states that Nat threw the necklace in the ocean, Della appears and calls him a liar.  The police captain then slugs Charlie in the face, and after extracting the necklace from his pocket, handcuffs him.   \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Lucy unwittingly disrupts the home life of her well-meaning son George and his wife Anita by interfering with Anita's career as a bridge teacher and causing George and Anita's reckless daughter Rhoda to stop bringing her male friends home.

"Name": "Dig That Uranium",
"Storyline": "In the Bowery in New York City, longtime friends Horace DeBussy \"Sach\" Jones, Terence Aloysius \"Slip\" Mahoney, Butch and Chuck regularly gather at Louie Dumbrowski's soda shop.  One day, Sach brings in another old friend, Shifty Robertson, who claims he is now a wealthy uranium mine owner. Although Shifty offers no explanation, he is anxious to sell the deed to his Little Daisy mine.  Slip pressures Louie into buying the deed, after which Shifty runs from the shop.  Some time later, the Bowery friends arrive in Panther Pass, Nevada, where their jalopy breaks down.  Local henchmen Joe Hody and Frank Loomis shoot at the New Yorkers from the hotel, hoping to dissuade them from remaining in town.  Slip, Sach and the others unwittingly flee for safety into the town's sole hotel. Hotel owner Ron Haskell, who has hired Hody and Loomis to discourage prospective prospectors, tells them there are no vacancies.  When Slip, Sach, Louie, Butch and Chuck have lunch at the hotel restaurant, the waitress, Jeannette, overhears Sach bragging about their lucrative mine.  After Sach unintentionally spills Loomis' drink at the bar Loomis insists Sach drink \"Old Vesuvius,\" a powerful liquor.  A brawl then ensues as Slip, Butch and Chuck defend their friend. Meanwhile, Jeannette reports to Haskell what she heard about the mine.  As a result, Haskell breaks up the fight and is suddenly solicitous, explaining there are new vacancies in the hotel.  Slip agrees to rent one room for all of them, unaware that Haskell is plotting to steal the mine.  That night, Jeannette attempts to seduce Sach, who unwittingly reveals that Louie has the Little Daisy mine deed with him.  After telling Sach to leave, Jeannette reports the information to Haskell, who invites Louie to join him, Hody and Loomis in a poker game.  Although they attempt to cheat Louie in order to force him to stake the deed as collateral, he intercepts the cards they are surreptitiously passing under the table to each other.  To Haskell's dismay, Louie wins the game.  The next day, the auto mechanic explains that he has improved the speed on the car's reverse gear, and after paying him for his work, the Bowery Boys drive to the mine in Bearclaw Canyon. Sach uses the Geiger counter but detects no uranium, so Slip tries to take it from him. Hody and Loomis observe them through binoculars, and believe that they are arguing because they have found uranium.  After Hody and Loomis leave to report to Haskell, the Bowery Boys encounter an old prospector named Hank \"Mac\" McKenzie, who informs them they have not found uranium because the Little Daisy is actually an old silver mine.  Slip blames Sach and hits him on the head, and they later realize they are too poor to return home. When a rock is thrown through their hotel room window, the attached note warns them to stay away from Bearclaw Canyon.  Slip concludes this means there is actually uranium in the area and they decide to set up camp in the desert to continue prospecting.  The next day, Butch and Chuck return from their first foray with nothing but Mac, who is welcomed. To encourage the weary men to persevere, Mac tells a story about the rugged old West and an outlaw named Pecos Pete.  While he is talking, Sach closes his eyes and imagines Mac's story with Hody and Loomis as the outlaws, himself and Slip as heroic Rangers, and their friends as the other characters: Pecos Pete and his partner Idaho burst into a saloon and demand a drink from the bartender Louie.  When the rebellious saloon girl, Jeannette, tells Pecos he could not bully them if the Rangers were present, Pecos kisses her.  Moments later, the Rangers, Sach and Slip, enter the saloon and confront Pecos and Idaho, who draw their weapons.  The Rangers disarm the outlaws by firing at them, and Pecos and Idaho flee after arranging for a showdown at dusk.  That night, Pecos and Idaho bring reinforcements to the shoot-out, but the Rangers handily dispatch four of the men, leaving Pecos and Idaho.  Believing that only Pecos is alive, Slip approaches his hiding place. Jeannette warns Sach that Idaho is still alive, and Sach saves Slip by killing Idaho, after which Slip kills Pecos.  Sach awakens as Mac finishes his story, and they are all inspired to renew their search in the morning.  The next day, Hody and Loomis report to Haskell that there is no uranium at the Little Daisy, prompting him to believe that Slip and his gang have tricked him into searching in the wrong place.  Shortly afterward, Sach finds uranium nearby and alerts Mac, but they are attacked by Haskell and his men, who have been watching them.  Mac flees on his burro, Josephine, but Sach appears to be hit by a bullet and falls over a cliff.  After Mac reports back to camp, everyone piles into the jalopy to find Sach.  Sach awakens and discovers that he is unharmed and has landed on a ledge, and soon after, his friends rescue him with a rope.  However, Haskell stops them before they can leave the area, and threatens to kill them.  Invigorated by the encounter, Sach infuriates Slip by suggesting to Haskell that the most convenient method of killing them would be to send them over a cliff in their own car.  Haskell likes the idea, and orders Slip at gunpoint to drive, while he and his henchmen follow in another car.  However, Slip uses the supercharged reverse installed by the mechanic to elude Haskell and his men.  After a lengthy chase, Haskell's car sails off a cliff and crashes.  Sach, Slip, Louis, Butch and Chuck discover that the crash dislodged some earth by the Little Daisy Mine, revealing uranium.  Moments later, they are confronted by an Indian tribe, which claims the mine because it is part of their reservation.  A disappointed Slip rejects the chief's offer of flowers.  However, Sach gratefully accepts Spring Wildflowers, who is actually a beautiful Indian maiden.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "In New York's Bowery, landlady Mrs. Kate Kelly encourages her star boarder, Horace DeBussy \"Sach\" Jones, in his pursuit of becoming an artistic photographer and inventor of unusual cameras.  When fellow boarder Danny comes home after his boss fires him for being in the stockroom when $200 was stolen from the store cash register, Sach and their pal, Stanislaus \"Duke\" Coveleskie, go to newspaper editor Ray Vance, hoping to win the money in the paper's photography contest.  The contest has been over for six months, but because Vance is desperate to get a photograph of notorious mobster Frankie Arbo, and his own photographer is injured, he hires Sach and agrees to give him a $200 advance.  The boys take a hotel room across the street from Arbo's and spy on him and his girl friend, Mae Randall, but their attempts to get an incriminating picture are foiled by Sach's bumbling.  After talking things over with Danny and their friend Chuck Anderson, Duke hatches a plan for an undercover operation.  Disguised as a goatee-wearing French decorator, Sach goes to Mae's apartment and says the management has hired him.  While Mae is trying to decide upon a color scheme, Sach suggests asking her boyfriend for advice, and a few minutes later, Frankie comes to the apartment, accompanied by cohort Chips Conroy.  While Frankie tells Mae that he and Chips are working on a big deal, Sach quickly takes a flash photograph, after which the enraged Frankie and Chips go after him and Duke.  With the aid of a sliding-door closet, the boys narrowly escape, then go to Vance, who is being pressured by his boss to get an incriminating photo of Frankie.  Vance is delighted that Sach and Duke have pictures, but when Sach accidentally exposes the role of film, Vance throws them out of the office.  Back at the boardinghouse, Sach is perfecting a new camera concealed inside a high-flame lighter when Danny and Chuck, who, on Duke's instructions, were following Frankie, report that he has gone to the Hula Hut, a Westchester nightclub he now owns.  Because Danny's boss has refused to rehire him, despite Danny's giving him Sach's $200, Danny has taken a job as a waiter at the Hula Hut.  Sometime later, Danny is clearing dishes in Frankie's office when he overhears Frankie's conversation with Chicago gangster Vic Savigne.  Danny learns that gangster Handsome Hal Lomax is coming to New York that afternoon and that neither Frankie nor Chips knows what he looks like.  After Duke obtains a photograph of Hal, he and Sach pick Hal up at the airport and take him back to the boardinghouse.  They enlist Mrs. Kelly to pretend she runs the boardinghouse as a hideout for local gangsters and use a radio set up by Chuck to broadcast phony news reports that Hal has been seen nearby.  After observing Hal's pronounced tics and hypochondria, Sach tells him he must stay in the boardinghouse to elude the police, then secretly calls Vance to tell him they are working on a big scoop and will have lots of pictures for him.  Pretending to be Hal, and accompanied by Duke, Sach goes to the Hula Hut to meet Frankie.  Despite his exaggerated impersonation, Sach convinces Frankie that he is Hal and takes photographs of him, Chips and their cohorts with his camera lighter.  Now Frankie reveals that he has a large supply of excellent-quality counterfeit twenty dollar bills that he will sell to them for twenty percent of face value.  As Sach is examining the phony bills, Vic calls from Chicago and asks to speak with Hal.  The nervous Sach pretends to have a cold, so Vic does not recognize that he is not the real Hal and warns him that Hal's jealous ex-girl friend,  Dolly Tate, has left for New York.  Meanwhile, at the boardinghouse, the real Hal leaves his room to make a phone call and sees Chuck as he is broadcasting another phony news report.  Hal pulls a gun on Chuck, but flees the boardinghouse when Mrs. Kelly confronts him with an old shotgun that accidentally discharges  At the Hula Hut, Frankie is becoming suspicious of Sach when he fails to recognize counterfeiter Otto Brock, whom he had previously said he knew.  At that moment, the real Hal comes to the club and demands that Mae let him in to see Frankie.  Frankie determines to find out who the imposter is just as Dolly arrives at the club.  Learning what is going on from Frankie, Dolly says that she will point out the real Hal, but inside the office, while Hal pleads with her to identify him, she throws her arms about Sach.  As Frankie's cohorts start to drag the real Hal away, Sach asks Dolly if he may take her picture for his album.  Her amazement at his lighter camera attracts Frankie's attention, after which he and the others chase after Duke and Sach.  The boys hide in the counterfeiting room and close its secret panels.  Each time the gangsters open the panels, Sach pelts them with a coconut catapulted from Brock's printing press.  Soon the police arrive, having been alerted by Danny.  After the police take away the gangsters and their girl friends, Danny, Vance and Chuck find Sach and Duke behind the panels.  Despite the fact that Sach has hit him in the head with a coconut, Vance is overjoyed to learn that Sach has gotten the incriminating photographs.  However, when Sach accidentally exposes the film, Vance and Duke grab machetes from a wall decoration and chase after him.  The next day, Duke and Sach are working at their new jobs for Vance, selling newspapers outside the building.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "When good-hearted Louie Dumbrowsky returns to his soda parlor in the Bowery after a vacation, regular Slip Mahoney and dizzy parlor cashier Cynthia welcome him. Louie then stumbles upon his pals Sach and Whitey, who are holding a séance in the backroom. Furious about the spiritual shenanigans, Louie lectures all the Bowery Boys--Slip, Sach, Whitey, Chuck and Butch--and kicks Whitey and his equipment out. Later that evening, Sach and Whitey, still faithful to the idea of contacting spirits, attend an exclusive séance with Margo the medium. While the audience gives its undivided attention to Margo, a three-hundred-year-old pilgrim ghost named Edgar appears to the film audience, warning them that real ghosts are only sent to Earth for important matters, like revealing Margo' s quackery. On Margo's stage, a ghost appears but a press photographer shoots a flash picture, interrupting the séance and causing the audience to disband. Meanwhile, at the Mahoney home, Slip discovers that his mother's friend and neighbor, Mrs. Parelli, is desperate to pay a medium named Madame Zola $100 to make Mrs. Parelli's deceased son Frankie appear before her. Slip, determined to reveal the deception, convinces Louie to hold a séance and bring back the ghost of Louie's wealthy Uncle Jake. During the séance one of the boys appears in disguise as Uncle Jake and borrows $100. Later, after Slip has given the $100 to Mrs. Parelli, the inconsolable mother visits Zola, who calls up the ghost of her son. However, the boys break in and expose the hoax. While being interrogated by Slip, Zola reveals that she works for Margo, and Slip then forces her to set up an appointment with Margo for Louie to contact Uncle Jake. Back at the soda parlor Slip gives Louie the $100, telling him Uncle Jake returned the loan and requested that Louie go to see Margo. Later at Margo's, Louie reluctantly enters alone to meet with the medium. As the rest of the boys look for another entrance, Edgar visits Sach and mysteriously opens a locked door for him. Sach soon discovers that only he can see and hear Edgar, when the boys return and call Sach insane because he is talking out loud to no one. While the boys case the house for evidence of Margo's hoax, Edgar leads Sach directly to the trick room, filled with costumes, accessories and a record player to create the ghostly presences. In the séance room, Margo flips a hidden switch to start the record player but when the ghost voice on the album skips, one of Margo's henchmen is sent to check the room. Sach escapes with the help of Edgar's special trick: Edgar draws a chalk door on a wall and magically opens a real door into the next room. After finding the boys in the next room, Sach leads them into the trick room, where Margo's henchmen capture all but Sach. Once outside Sach and Edgar go in search of a phone and call Cynthia for reinforcements. Meanwhile the henchmen drop the rest of the boys into a basement room that is quickly filling with water. In the séance room Margo receives hypnotists Professor Krantz and Dr. Siegfried and the professionals explain that hypnosis is a much more secure method of manipulating her audience than the tricks she employs. Soon after Sach and Edgar return and, with chalk in hand, Edgar opens a trap door in the basement room and frees the boys. The boys immediately enter the séance room, where Krantz hypnotizes them and Margo's henchmen carry them into the storage room. As Krantz explains that he can only hypnotize those with normal intelligence, Sach wakes up from the spell but keeps still until the Krantz and his cohorts leave. Meanwhile Cynthia and ineffectual private detective Jack Eagen, having just arrived, join Louie and discover Sach and the boys. Using an old witches' chant Edgar has shared with him, Sach releases all but Slip from the spell. After Sach slaps stubborn Slip back to reality, the henchmen return to dispose of the boys but they mount a surprise attack and triumph. Later, at the soda parlor, when Edgar appears to Sach, the boys once again think Sach has gone mad.

Grogan is on vacation, but Sach and Slip accept a case from Selena Webster, who claims her sister, Eleanor Williams, is missing.  Slip and Sach then form a detective agency with their friends, and their first assignment is to visit Dr. Rolfe Carter, a psychic from whom Eleanor had been seeking advice after the disappearance of her husband Tom.  After the boys are thrown out of Carter's office, they follow him to the Wentworth Arms apartments.  Slip enters room 5C just as Carter is shot to death and is knocked out.  When he revives, he sees Eleanor calling the police and finds a bundle of letters.  Slip tells Eleanor that he was hired by her sister to find her, but she denies having a sister and conjectures that the killer worked for a man named Dr. Armand. In Louie's Sweet Shop, Slip pays an informer to identify Armand, and learns that he heads a syndicate that controls fortune-tellers. Under an assumed name, Slip pays Armand to read his fortune in order to get his fingerprints. Armand knows who he is, however, and holds him and Sach hostage. Selena, who is Armand's assistant, explains to Slip that Armand used fortune-telling to learn incriminating secrets about her and Eleanor, then tried to blackmail them. Eleanor, believing her husband Tom was dead, began a love affair, but when she received word that Tom was alive, she hired Carter to steal from Armand some love letters she wrote.  Carter stole a bundle of letters, including Selena's, but Eleanor's were not among them, and before he could switch Selena's letters for Eleanor's, he was killed.  Selena helps Slip and Sach escape, and they elude Armand's henchmen by posing as the \"brain trust\" of Professor Quizard on a radio game show. Later, at Louie's, Selena visits Slip, Sach and the boys, who ask her for an affidavit stating that Armand killed Carter.  Armand enters with his henchmen, however, and waits for Eleanor.

Slip then discovers that he and the boys made no money on the case, and tells Alice he cannot afford their dream honeymoon.

Within days he is hard at work in boot camp and discovers that the rest of the boys have been drafted. Tracing the trail of havoc that Sach has wreaked across the camp, Slip finds his bumbling pal impersonating a doctor and examining Col. Thomas Brown. For this offense, the boys are put on K.P. duty, and there Sach fills the cook's soup with huge amounts of hot sauces and peppers. When Capt. Miller tastes it and becomes sick, Sach is sent to Brown's office, but once there, the colonel receives word that Sach's soup can be used as a weapon. Brown congratulates Sach and then, upon realizing that Sach's father was his drill sergeant and good friend, promotes Sach to sergeant. Sach's new position immediately goes to his head, and he begins to lead his men, who include the Bowery Boys, on long, hard hikes. On one hike, Slip discovers Pvt. Hardy lying near a stream, beaten unconscious, and after calling an ambulance, picks up a playing card lying near the body. The next day, Sach procures five twelve-hour passes and takes the bys out on the town. On the street, he woos beautiful Lulu Mae, who takes them all to a gambling house run by Jolly Joe Johnson. The boys watch in wonder as each of their successful wagers suddenly becomes a losing hand before their eyes. Slip, realizing the tables are all rigged, notices that the blackjack cards match the design of Pvt. Hardy's card. Later that night, after Sach loses all his money, the boys plot to have him demoted. Slip places a fake bomb in Sach's arms as he sleeps and when the sergeant wakes, he disrupts the entire camp by racing around screaming that the enemy has attacked. Miller chastises Sach but, when he throws the bomb out of the window, it explodes, and as a result Sach is promoted to staff sergeant and awarded a medal. The next day, Slip learns that Hardy has died and so visits the local sheriff and conjectures that Hardy was killed when he discovered Johnson's outfit was crooked. The sheriff, who is on Johnson's payroll, informs Johnson immediately and they decree that Slip must be quieted. Meanwhile, Slip and Sach also go to Brown, who puts two intelligence officers, Maj. Desmond and Capt. Harlow, on the case. Together, they all go to Johnson's to witness the crooked gambling, but Johnson recognizes them and allows them to win. On bivouac the next day, Slip camouflages his foxholes so cleverly that first Miller and then Brown fall in, and Sach is promoted to technical sergeant for supposedly teaching his men so well. Sach later loses his whistle and tears the boys' bunks apart looking for it. When an inspection is called, the boys are punished for their sloppy beds. A dance is held that evening, and Johnson sends Lulu Mae there to cause trouble for Sach. She sneaks into the barracks late that night and hides in his bed, but when Brown hears a woman is in the camp and searches for her, she hides from him and then lets the boys into Johnson's closed gambling house. Slip searches the tables and discovers that each has a set of magnets underneath to move the chips and cards around. After they prove Johnson is corrupt, the boys are sent back to the camp. There, they discover that Brown has been replaced by a new colonel, who immediately demotes Sach to private and promotes Slip to sergeant.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "At the Bowery Garage in New York City, Terence Aloysius \"Slip\" Mahoney orders his lazy assistant, Horace Debussy \"Sach\" Jones, to park an expensive car \"right straight ahead.\" Sach, not knowing that the \"R\" on the car's steering column means reverse, believes he is putting the car into \"right straight ahead\" and crashes into the garage's rear wall. Even though infuriated Slip fires him, Sach is attempting to fix the car's dents with a sledgehammer when the car's owner, H. Stuyvesant Jones, arrives to claim it. Much to Slip's bewilderment, Jones's initial anger is defused upon learning Sach's name, and that he is an only child who was abandoned at birth. After promising to contact Sach soon, Jones leaves and returns to the Larchmont estate where he lives with his duplicitious niece Clarissa, her boyfriend, chauffeur Marten, and his young nephew, Terwilliger \"Twig\" Jones III. Jones and Clarissa have squandered their share of the vast Terwilliger fortune and are hoping to defraud Twig out of his larger portion by inventing a \"lost\" heir. Jones believes that they will be able to alter Sach's birth certificate to make it appear that he is the son of the family patriarch's ne'er-do-well son Pierpont, who disappeared years earlier. Clarissa worries that Frisbie the butler, who is devoted to Twig, will interfere, but Jones is undeterred. As they are discussing their plan, they are interrupted by Twig, who immediately senses that they are scheming against him yet again. Twig and Frisbie call Twig's lawyer, Sam Cosgrove, to alert him to the potential danger, but unknown to them, Cosgrove is in league with Jones. Soon after, Jones returns to the garage and there informs Sach that he has found Sach's birth certificate, which proves that he is the heir to the estate of copper magnate Terwilliger Pierpont Jones. Sach is thrilled, but the suspicious Slip insists on accompanying him to Larchmont, along with their pal Louie Dumbrowski. At the estate, Cosgrove examines the forged records and asserts that Sach's claim is legitimate, much to the dismay of Twig and Frisbie. Sach is eager to receive his half-a-million dollars, but Cosgrove states that the bank representative will not arrive until the following day to formalize the transaction. That evening, the Joneses host a musical soiree, featuring pianist Señor Palumbo, to introduce Sach to their society friends. The event is spoiled when Twig lets loose his collection of trained fleas, and afterward, Twig and Frisbie accuse Sach and Slip of attempting fraud. Upon hearing their concerns, Slip is determined to find Sach's birth certificate and learn the truth. After a few misadventures, the group finds the certificate, and Louie, who knew Sach's parents, confirms that it is fraudulent. Angered that they have been duped, Slip decides to help Twig prove that Jones is a criminal, but Sach, who misses the Bowery, wants to return home. When Jones discovers that the certificate is missing, he orders Clarissa to stall Sach while they search for it. Clarissa kisses Sach and searches his pockets while caressing him, but abruptly gives up when she determines that he does not have the paper. After Sach, covered with lipstick, returns to their room, Slip yells at him for \"colluding with the enemy,\" but Sach refuses to believe that Clarissa is guilty. Meanwhile, Twig and Frisbie, still unaware of Cosgrove's true allegiance, have informed him of their discovery, and then report back to Slip. The group splits up, and when Sach is trapped in the library by Jones and a pistol-wielding Cosgrove, he realizes that Cosgrove is a crook. Slip, Twig and Frisbie enter the library, and despite Sach's use of Pig Latin to warn Slip, the friends are captured and Jones regains the birth certificate. Marten locks Slip, Twig, Frisbie and Louie in the attic while the others hold Sach in the library to await the bank representative, Henry Baldwin. When Baldwin arrives, Cosgrove warns him that Sach is eccentric, and then attempts to force Sach to sign the papers releasing the money to him. While Sach is doing his best to stall, Slip lowers Twig out the attic window, using electrical wire, and Twig rushes back upstairs to release them. They knock out Marten and run to the library, where they tell Baldwin that Cosgrove is crooked, and then attempt to elude Jones and the recovered Marten, who are trying to shoot them. With the aid of a toy train, toy bow and arrows and fencing equipment, Slip and his friends apprehend the criminals, and Baldwin calls the police. Later, Slip and Sach are back at their garage, which now boasts all of the latest, modern equipment, thanks to the generous Twig. Twig and Frisbie arrive to pick up their car, and Sach begins to pull it out. Not knowing that Sach was about to put the car out of reverse and into drive, Slip pulls him from the driver's seat and jumps in, then promptly drives the car into the wall again.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Hold That Baby!",
"Storyline": "After Slip Mahoney and Horace Debussy \"Sach\" Jones, who work for a New York laundry service, crash their delivery van, they are fired. The boys convince Louie Dumbrowsky to allow them to use a back room of his sweet shop to set up Slip Mahoney Enterprises and install several washing and drying machines, supplied by the company at which their friend, Gabe Moreno, is employed. One day, a young widow, Laura Andrews, abandons her baby in one of the laundromat's baskets. Later, Hope and Faith Andrews, the aunts of Laura's late husband, bribe a doctor to have Laura committed to a sanitarium, stating that she is deteriorating mentally. When the police bring Laura home, however, she claims that Hope and Faith have been trying to drive her crazy for some time and refuses to tell them where she has left the baby, who is entitled to inherit his late grandfather's estate. Meanwhile, the boys have found the baby and are trying to feed him, but he rejects Louie's offer of hamburger and fries. \"Bananas,\" a mobster and one of the boys's acquaintances, discovers from a newspaper headline that the baby is the missing Andrews heir and proposes to his boss, Cherry-Nose Gray, that they pick up the $25,000 reward. They visit the Andrews sisters, who as students of criminology recognize them as gangsters and even have files on them. The sisters, who can control their brother's fortune if Laura is not around, offer them $50,000 to keep the baby out of sight for a few days. Cherry-Nose shows Slip the newspaper and asks the boys to hold the baby in return for some cash. Inadvertently, Slip then signs a ransom note, which Cherry-Nose keeps as \"insurance.\" Later, Burton, a police patrolman, visits the sweet shop and hears the baby crying, but the boys manage to fool him. After Slip reads in a newspaper that Laura has been committed to Midvale Sanitarium for special treatment, he decides to visit and quiz her. Slip takes Sach along, but is forced to register him as a disturbed patient. Posing as a myopic psychiatrist, Slip locates Laura and tells her about her baby's whereabouts. Meanwhile, Sach wanders around, finds the operating room, which he mistakes for a toy shop, and begins removing many items until he is interrupted by two doctors, who regard him as a very interesting specimen and prepare to operate on him immediately. After Slip hears Laura's account of the problems with her aunts, he finds Sach in time and they all escape. When Slip and Sach return to the sweet shop, they discover that Cherry-Nose is holding the other boys and the baby prisoners. Slip and Laura try to leave for the Andrews estate, where Andrews' will is about to be read, but are stopped by Cherry-Nose and his men. Gabe comes to their rescue and a brawl breaks out until Burton and another officer arrive. Meanwhile, at the Andrews estate, Hope and Faith listen as the lawyer reads their brother's will, which leaves everything to his grandson, providing he and his mother are present at the reading of the will. If they are not present, his estate is bequeathed to the sisters. After the lawyer opens a chest and discovers three million dollars inside, Hope prepares to sign for receipt of the money, when Slip, Sach, Laura and the baby arrive and confuse the lawyer. Hope draws a gun while Faith takes the chest, but they are prevented from leaving by the arrival of Burton and the other boys. Later, Sach resumes talking to a glamorous wax dummy with which he has become infatuated, and to Slip's consternation, she comes to life and walks off with Sach.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Stanislaus \"Duke\" Coveleskie is concerned when he and Horace DeBussy \"Sach\" Jones discover that their landlady, Kate Kelly, who has been reading a book about reincarnation, has made an appointment with the book's author, Dr. Simon Noble, to be hypnotized and \"regressed\" in order to find her former selves. Duke is aware of Noble's background in quack medicine and advises Mrs. Kelly to save her money, but she insists on keeping the appointment. Duke decides that he, Sach, Chuck and Myron, who are known as The Bowery Boys, will expose Noble before Mrs. Kelly hands over her cash, and when he finds out that Noble and his business partner, Jake Morgan, are hosting a press reception, the boys crash the event. Meanwhile, Noble and Morgan want to get rid of Noble's voluptuous, scatterbrained \"secretary,\" Cleo Daniels, because she knows that the subject in Noble's book was paid by the doctor to say what he told her about her previous lives. Duke challenges Noble to regress him in front of the reporters and although the doctor fails to regress Duke, Sach falls into a hypnotic trance after staring at one of Cleo's earrings that Noble is using to hypnotize Duke. Sach tells them that he is Algy Winkle and, in a flashback, he enters a 1682, Charleston, South Carolina inn to collect taxes. Algy confronts notorious pirate Blackbeard and insists that he pay taxes on all his loot. Impressed by Algy's naïve gall, Blackbeard challenges him to a self-devised game of chance and wagers a map showing where his treasure is buried against Algy's tax receipts for the day. Although Algy has never played the game, he wins and a fight breaks out. Back in the present, Sach wakes up before he can tell Noble if he found the treasure. Duke and the boys, impressed by the apparent veracity of Sach's experience, go to a library and research Algy Winkle's life. They discover that Algy was on his way to claim Blackbeard's treasure when he was drowned in a storm at sea. Duke believes that Sach can be hypnotized into remembering the map's details, so they return to Noble and offer him a share of the treasure, if it can be recovered. They soon discover, however, that the hypnosis does not work without Cleo's earring. As Morgan has paid off Cleo, the boys go looking for her and find her working as a swimsuit model in Jersey City. Cleo is willing to hand over her earrings, but insists upon a share of any treasure. When Noble finally regresses Sach, he goes back too far in time and Sach finds himself as Marc Antony, addressing the citizens of Ancient Rome. Algy eventually emerges and states that he memorized the map and gives explicit directions to a cave in Hudson's Cove. Noble and Morgan then pull out revolvers and state that they intend to claim the treasure for themselves. Leaving the still-hypnotized Sach with a gun and instructions to stop the others from following, Noble and Morgan leave. While the crooks attempt to locate the cave in greatly changed terrain, Cleo frees Sach from his trance by kissing him. When the boys arrive near the cave in their old jalopy, Sach finds an old magazine among the car's tools and suddenly realizes that his subconscious has created the entire Blackbeard episode as a result of his having read about the pirate in the magazine. An enraged Duke chases after Sach, who hides in a cave where he discovers a chest filled with jewelry. Noble and Morgan attempt to stop them from leaving, but the boys thwart them and leave with the jewels. Later, as the boys are hosting a celebratory party at Mrs. Kelly's, a police detective arrives to inform them that the \"treasure\" they found was actually stolen from a jewelry store six years earlier, and hidden by the robbers before they were arrested. Although the boys have to return all the jewelry, Sach still receives an exciting kiss from Cleo.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Hold That Line",
"Storyline": "At the alumni club of patrician Ivy University, businessman Morgan T. Stanhope argues that only students with \"blue blood\" can succeed at the college, while his old friend, A. J. Billingsley, declares that any student who tries hard, regardless of his background, can thrive. Stanhope agrees to wager a new addition for the chemistry building on the dispute, providing he is allowed to choose the students in question. The two stroll through town, and upon spotting The Bowery Boys piling out of their jalopy and into Louie Dumbrowski's malt shop, Stanhope announces to the horrified Billingsley that he has found his test subjects. In the shop, gang leader Terence Aloysius \"Slip\" Mahoney and his pals, bumbler Horace Debussy \"Sach\" Jones, Junior, Chuck and Butch, have just discovered that Louie needs $1,500 to bring his brother Morris' family to America. Therefore, when Stanhope and Billingsley enter and offer the boys tuition and a $1,500 bonus, although the gang is eager to avoid the hard work that college entails, they accept in order to give the bonus money to Louie. At the campus, Dean Forrester is appalled to learn that his benefactors have chosen such poor specimens for their experiment, but he agrees to let the boys matriculate. Outside, All-American football star Biff Wallace, his pal Harold and their girl friends, Katie Wayne and Penny Wells, greet the rowdy boys with equal amounts of amusement and dismay. Later, in chemistry class, Sach tries to formulate a miracle medicine but, on learning that he has instead mixed a batch of TNT, throws the potion out the window, where it explodes onto Forrester. As a result, the boys are threatened with expulsion, but Billingsley convinces the dean to give them one more chance. Sach returns to the chemistry lab and this time concocts a potion that gives him almost super-human strength. When he then joins the boys on the gym field, he shocks the coach with his physical prowess and is immediately named the new track and field star. Sach's subsequent status as campus idol angers Biff, especially after the boys join football practice and Sach easily flattens his competition. Slip notices that his friend's sudden might is waning, and when he learns about Sach's \"vitamin\" potion, he worries that Sach will not be able to repeat the formula. With this in mind, he shields Sach from contact with Biff, but accepts Harold's offer for the boys to pledge their fraternity. Biff devises embarrassing hazing rituals for the group, forcing them to dress as women and parade down the street into Louie's shop. Soon after, Louie decides to join the boys on campus, and proves a huge hit with the co-eds. Over the semester, Sach manages to repeat his potion and, under the nickname \"Hurricane Jones,\" leads the football team to a victorious season, which is to culminate in a match against their rival school, State. Just before the game, however, crooked gambler Mike Donelli realizes that if he can remove Sach from the game at the last minute, he can make a fortune by betting on State. He sends his girl friend, Candy Calin, to ask Biff to introduce her to Sach. Biff, hoping to regain some of his former glory, agrees, and Candy easily lures Sach to her apartment. There, Mike and his goon, Big Dave, knock out Sach and then drug him. The game begins, and although the school laments Sach's disappearance, Biff leads the team admirably. Unfortunately, Biff is injured toward the end of the game, and when Slip congratulates him on the sidelines, a guilt-stricken Biff confesses that Sach is being held at Candy's. The boys call the police and rush to the apartment, but although the gamblers are arrested, Sach cannot be awoken. They bring him back to the locker room and Slip attempts to duplicate the \"vitamin\" potion, which he offers to the dean to try. Forrester immediately shrinks to two feet tall, after which he once again threatens to expel the group. Sach finally revives, but with no time left to mix up a new potion, the boys take to the football field without special powers. Luckily, Slip takes control and confuses State with a series of backfield maneuvers, allowing him to run down the field unnoticed. He almost fails to make the touchdown when he bangs his head on the goal post, but the other team shoves him over the line accidentally, and Ivy wins the pennant. Later, back in the chemistry lab, Sach mixes a concoction that he vows will allow him to fly. When he jumps out the window, the gang is aghast until they realize that he has once again succeeded. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Before dying, Augie had kicked the money, which was wrapped in some newspaper, into the street, however, and it is found by Sach and Slip Mahoney, two members of the Bowery Boys youth gang. Gabe Dell, their reporter friend, announces their find in the newspaper, and gang member Jack \"Cold-Deck\" Shapiro comes to Louie's Sweet Shop, a Bowery Boys hangout, to collect the money at gunpoint.  Shapiro is poisoned by the man with the umbrella, but the money is not taken.  Sach and Slip call the police, and the hot-tempered Lieutenant James Q. Broaderik interrogates them. Later Slip decides to give the money to charity, but the rest of the gang, hearing a radio news flash about the donation, scheme to get the money.  The gang's ill-treated flunky, Tipper, turns informant and identifies the gang to the police as Benny, \"The Meatball,\" Lullaby Schmo, Candy McGill and Lippy Harris.  Meanwhile, Slip, Sach and their friends hide the money in their basement clubhouse, and are held up by Benny, who is then killed by the man with the umbrella.  Again the money is not taken, and the boys split up in search of the killer.  Candy and Lullaby pair up, intending to lure Slip to Candy's apartment, and Slip easily falls for her charms.  Lippy arrives at Candy's first, however, and kills Lullaby, and when Slip and Candy arrive, Lippy demands the money.  Slip then orders Sach to bring the money. Sach arrives with a rolled-up newspaper and hands it over to Lippy, who is killed outside the apartment. Gabe and Broaderik arrive with the boys, and Lullaby's dead body falls out of a closet. Although the killer absconded with the newspaper this time, Sach happily announces that it contains only his laundry, and that he has the money.  Slip, afraid of the jinx that the money seems to hold, turns it over to Broaderik.  The man with the umbrella turns out to be Tipper, who visits the boys's clubhouse and demands the money. Broaderick arrives in time to arrest him, and Gabe takes a photograph of Sach with the killer.  Broaderik later reports that the money now belongs to Slip, who doles it out in Louie's Sweet Shop to agents of local charities.  Louie is anxious to get the five dollars the boys owe him for malts, but Slip is forced to give the last $12,000 to Broaderik for taxes.  On the street, Slip eyes a five-dollar bill on the pavement, but swears that money as the root of all evil.  He then joins the boys in a dive for the money, but loses it to Louie.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Jalopy",
"Storyline": "Racecar owner Skid Wilson urges driver Tony Lango and mechanic Red Baker to keep his racing \"jalopy\" in prime condition because he has been raking in money by winning at the track.  Skid is curious when he reads that a new car has entered the race as the \"Mahoney Meteor,\" and that the owner is listed as Terrence Aloysius Mahoney.  Skid sends his girl friend, Bobbie Lane, to learn more. Meanwhile, Mahoney, also known as \"Slip,\" and his pals, Horace Debussy \"Sach\" Jones, Chuck and Butch, are testing the broken-down jalopy in their neighborhood in New York City's Bowery.  Sweets shop owner Louie Dombrowski begs them to move their noisy work elsewhere because it is ruining his business, but Slip reminds him that he will pay Louie's rent if he wins the jalopy derby.  In the back of Louie's store, Sach, while helping Professor Elrod Bosgood with an experiment, concocts a liquid that explodes when dropped on the floor.  When Bobbie emerges from the smoke, the boys conclude that the formula makes women magically appear.  Bobbie flirts with Slip and takes an interest in his car, so he gives her a pass to the next day's race.  The Mahoney Meteor is so slow during the race that the other cars pass it repeatedly, until it boils over and Slip crashes the car into a wall.  Sach attempts to help his friend but ends up chasing his hat all over the race track instead, which causes a massive pile-up.  Later, the boys sulk over their loss at Louie's.  Slip puts Sach to work waxing the floor while he tries to talk Louie into fronting them money to fix the jalopy and enter the next big race.  Sach, meanwhile, puts some of his secret formula into the waxing machine and it literally flies through the window and into the sky.  This inspires Slip to use the liquid in the gas tank of the jalopy, and in a test drive the car completes the track circuit in an astonishing eleven seconds.  Having observed the test drive, Skid and his friends try to extract information from the boys, and Sach mistakenly reveals that he put a special additive into the gas tank.  Slip and Sach report the good news to the Professor and get to work mixing up a new batch of the liquid.  When Sach throws some on the floor, Bobbie reappears with an invitation to Skid's pre-race party.  Once the group arrives at the party, Skid sends Tony and Red to search their laboratory for the secret formula.  After Tony and Red fail to find the formula, Skid takes the boys and Louie hostage in another room.  Sach purposely drops some of the formula and he and his friends escape in the smoke.  When they return to the lab they mix up another batch but are soon assaulted by Skid and his thugs, and a fistfight ensues.  After Louie calls the police, Skid, Red and Tony seem to disappear.  Once the police leave, the thugs return and are only satisfied when Sach's new formula proves ineffective.  Sach later realizes he left out a crucial element of the formula: seltzer water.  On the day of the big race, Skid is confident that Slip will lose.  Once the race begins, Slip's jalopy putters around the track until Sach arrives.  After pouring the liquid into the gas tank, the car's speed accelerates, but this time, in reverse.  With Sach clinging to the side, Slip outraces the other cars by driving around the track in the proper direction with the car in reverse.  When Slip wins the race, Skid tells Bobbie she will have to return her new fur coat.  At a celebration at Louie's shop, Sach purposely spills some liquid after which a beautiful woman appears and leaves with Slip.  Sach pours some more to create his own dream girl, but a bespectacled woman for the Professor appears instead.  After Sach follows them out the door of the shop, Louie tries to create his own woman, but bursts into tears when nothing happens.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

A religious woman and loving wife, Petunia is heartened by Little Joe's promise to repent his sins in church. Little Joe soon resumes his gambling, however, when gambler Domino Johnson entices him to return to the casino at Jim Henry's Paradise Café.  Petunia later goes in search of Little Joe, only to discover that he has been shot in a gunfight at the Paradise Café.  As Petunia prays over her wounded husband, Lucifer, Jr., the ghost of Little Joe's friend Lucius, enters the room and orders Little Joe to \"report to duty.\"  Little Joe does not believe that he is dying until Lucifer, Jr. and his three aides show him his lifeless body. When the General, responding to Petunia's prayers, suddenly appears in the room, Lucifer, Jr. engages him in a battle for Little Joe's soul.  While Sgt. Fleetfoot is sent by the General to get a judgment on Little Joe's case from the Lord, Lucifer, Jr. predicts that Little Joe's involvement with vamp Georgia Brown will result in his banishment to Hell. The Lord determines that Little Joe is not fit for Heaven, but he permits Little Joe to return to Earth for six months and prove his worth.   With no recollection of his meeting with the Lord or Lucifer, Jr., Little Joe regains consciousness and begins his six-month reprieve.  Petunia believes her husband's recovery to be a miracle, but both she and Little Joe are unaware that Lucifer, Jr. and the General will be talking to his conscience and battling for his soul. No sooner does Little Joe resume his daily life than his gambling pals, Jim Henry and Dude, who have been sent by Lucifer, Jr., try to tempt him into a game of dice.  Petunia chases Jim and Dude away, but Lucifer, Jr. devises another scheme to distract Little Joe and make him backslide into Hell. Heeding the advice of those working at the Hotel Hades Idea Department, Lucifer, Jr. decides to corrupt Little Joe with riches, and sends him a winning lottery ticket.  Little Joe's chances at getting into Heaven improve when he plans to use the money to buy Petunia a washing machine and a house, but when Georgia intervenes, Little Joe returns to the Paradise Café. Petunia succeeds in winning back her husband by going to the casino and singing better than Georgia, but before they leave, a gun battle ensues and Petunia and Little Joe are shot and killed.  Furious at Lucifer, Jr.'s meddling, the General sends down a storm and wrecks the Paradise Café. In Purgatory, Petunia is told that she is eligible to pass through the Pearly Gates into Heaven, while Little Joe is rejected.  It is only after Little Joe repents and the Lord vouches for him that the General reverses his decision and allows Little Joe to join his wife in Heaven.  Moments after he is told of the decision, Little Joe realizes that his brush with the afterlife was all a dream, and vows to change his ways.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The Man with the Golden Arm",
"Storyline": "In the late 1940s, Frankie Majcinek, who is known as Frankie Machine, returns to Chicago's South Side, which is mostly inhabited by Polish Americans, after serving a six-month sentence at a federal narcotics hospital.  The denizens of Antek's Tug `n' Maul Tavern, Frankie's favorite bar, are pleased to see Frankie, especially his best friend, \"lost dog finder\" Sparrow.  Although Frankie's former drug supplier, Nifty Louie Fomorowski, offers Frankie a free \"fix,\" Frankie refuses and vows to Sparrow that he has kicked narcotics for good and intends to become a drummer for a big-name band.  Frankie proudly shows off the drums he was given at the hospital, and after sending Sparrow to find him some new clothes, goes to the roominghouse where he lives with his wheelchair-bound wife Zosh.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe neurotic Zosh, determined to keep Frankie with her by whatever means necessary, has manipulated him for three years by playing on his guilt over causing the accident that injured her while he was driving drunk.  Zosh is dubious about his plans to become a musician and urges him to return to dealing poker for Zero Schwiefka.  Frankie's consistent method of dealing has earned him a city-wide reputation as \"the man with the golden arm,\" but Frankie is determined to improve his life so that he is not tempted to return to drugs.  Frankie calls Harry Lane, a musical agent referred to him by his doctor at the narcotics hospital, and makes an appointment to see him.  After Sparrow returns with a \"borrowed\" suit for Frankie to wear, they stop at Antek's for a drink and there run into Schwiefka.  Frankie announces his intention to quit dealing, and the angry Schwiefka notifies \"Cousin\" Kvorka, a local beat policeman, that Frankie and Sparrow shoplifted a suit.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nKvorka takes the pair to police captain \"Record Head\" Bednar, who wearily ignores Frankie's protests that he has a job interview and insists that he be locked up.  Schwiefka then offers to bail out Frankie and Sparrow if Frankie returns to deal for him, and Frankie is forced to accept.  Disturbed by a jailed junkie's tormented plea for a fix, Frankie returns home, where Zosh is pleased that he is going back to dealing cards.  That night, Louie's taunts about Frankie's shaking hand unnerve the dealer and he leaves to visit the Safari Club, a nearby strip bar where Frankie's former sweetheart, Molly Novotny, works as a b-girl.  Although Molly and Frankie are still in love, Frankie's guilt over causing Zosh's paralysis have kept them apart.  Frankie tries to tell Molly that she should leave her current boyfriend, the chiseling, alcoholic Drunkie John, but Molly states that she needs someone to stave off her deep-seated loneliness.  Soon after, Frankie has an interview with Lane, who promises to call him with an audition for a band, but warns him that if he backslides even once, Lane will no longer sponsor him.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nDespite Frankie's happiness, Zosh nags at him that he is being unrealistic in striving for a better life.  A week passes without word from Lane, and Frankie sinks into depression, until one afternoon, Frankie runs into Louie and, succumbing to temptation, accompanies Louie to his apartment for a fix.  Louie gleefully tells Frankie that \"the monkey never dies\" as he injects him with the drug, and Frankie is hooked again.  Later, after yet another quarrel with Zosh, Frankie storms down to Antek's.  There he meets Molly, who encourages him to call Lane, telling him that Lane probably lost his phone number.  Molly proves to be correct, and Lane arranges for Frankie to audition for Shorty Rogers' band on the coming Monday.  Frankie then pleads with Molly to let him practice playing his drums in her room, as the spiteful Zosh has forbidden him to do so in their room.  Although she is reluctant to encourage Frankie's hopes of building a future for the two of them, Molly agrees, and when she comes home early the next morning, he happily greets her.  After bragging that he has quit Schwiefka and joined the musicians' union, Frankie promises Molly that he is going to kick drugs again, and that after he has made some money and can send Zosh to a clinic, they will be together.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Schwiefka and Louie search for Frankie, as they have used Frankie's reputation to lure two big-time gamblers, Markette and Williams, to play in Schwiefka's poker game.  After Zosh urges Frankie to deal the big game and tears up his musicians' union card, Frankie seeks refuge at Antek's, where Louie offers him some of the profits if he will deal for Markette and Williams.  Desperately needing the money, Frankie agrees, and again gives in when Louie tempts him with another fix.

After dealing all night, an exhausted Frankie insists on leaving, but when he arrives home, he is suddenly overwhelmed by the need for a fix and rushes back to Schwiefka's.  Louie refuses to give Frankie any drugs unless he resumes dealing, because Markette and Williams have begun to win.  As the hours pass, the game continues, and soon it is early Monday morning.  Louie promises Frankie that if he cheats and wins, he will give him a fix, but Frankie, weary from his long hours of dealing, becomes careless, and Williams spots his card-palming and beats him.  After Louie then refuses to give Frankie any drugs, Frankie knocks him out and searches his apartment, to no avail.  Frankie then goes to his audition but cannot play competently due to his withdrawal symptoms.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Louie regains consciousness and goes to the roominghouse to exact his revenge upon Frankie.  Instead, Louie accidentally enters the room as Zosh is walking and deduces that she has been pretending to be paralyzed.  When Louie threatens to reveal her secret, the hysterical Zosh pushes him down the stairwell to his death.  Frankie, not knowing of Louie's death but fearing that he is after him, runs away and finds Molly, whom he begs for help.  While Bednar is questioning Zosh, Molly learns from John that Frankie is Bednar's main suspect.  Molly then agrees to help Frankie quit drugs cold turkey, so that he can go to the police sober and withstand questioning to prove his innocence.  After an agonizing few days, during which Frankie suffers great torment, he is free of his craving.  John sees Frankie in Molly's apartment, however, and alerts Bednar.  Frankie leaves before Bednar arrives, and Molly takes the police captain to Zosh's, where Frankie is telling her that he is going away with Molly.  Just as a terrified Zosh gets up from her wheelchair to chase after Frankie, Bednar and Molly arrive, and they all realize that Zosh must have killed Louie.  Before Bednar can arrest her, Zosh runs out to the fire escape and falls to street below.  Frankie rushes to the street, where Zosh lays dying, and holds her as she tells him she loves him.  After Zosh dies, Frankie and Molly slowly walk off together, leaving their old life behind.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The Man with the Golden Arm",
"Storyline": "In the late 1940s, Frankie Majcinek, who is known as Frankie Machine, returns to Chicago's South Side, which is mostly inhabited by Polish Americans, after serving a six-month sentence at a federal narcotics hospital.  The denizens of Antek's Tug `n' Maul Tavern, Frankie's favorite bar, are pleased to see Frankie, especially his best friend, \"lost dog finder\" Sparrow.  Although Frankie's former drug supplier, Nifty Louie Fomorowski, offers Frankie a free \"fix,\" Frankie refuses and vows to Sparrow that he has kicked narcotics for good and intends to become a drummer for a big-name band.  Frankie proudly shows off the drums he was given at the hospital, and after sending Sparrow to find him some new clothes, goes to the roominghouse where he lives with his wheelchair-bound wife Zosh.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe neurotic Zosh, determined to keep Frankie with her by whatever means necessary, has manipulated him for three years by playing on his guilt over causing the accident that injured her while he was driving drunk.  Zosh is dubious about his plans to become a musician and urges him to return to dealing poker for Zero Schwiefka.  Frankie's consistent method of dealing has earned him a city-wide reputation as \"the man with the golden arm,\" but Frankie is determined to improve his life so that he is not tempted to return to drugs.  Frankie calls Harry Lane, a musical agent referred to him by his doctor at the narcotics hospital, and makes an appointment to see him.  After Sparrow returns with a \"borrowed\" suit for Frankie to wear, they stop at Antek's for a drink and there run into Schwiefka.  Frankie announces his intention to quit dealing, and the angry Schwiefka notifies \"Cousin\" Kvorka, a local beat policeman, that Frankie and Sparrow shoplifted a suit.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nKvorka takes the pair to police captain \"Record Head\" Bednar, who wearily ignores Frankie's protests that he has a job interview and insists that he be locked up.  Schwiefka then offers to bail out Frankie and Sparrow if Frankie returns to deal for him, and Frankie is forced to accept.  Disturbed by a jailed junkie's tormented plea for a fix, Frankie returns home, where Zosh is pleased that he is going back to dealing cards.  That night, Louie's taunts about Frankie's shaking hand unnerve the dealer and he leaves to visit the Safari Club, a nearby strip bar where Frankie's former sweetheart, Molly Novotny, works as a b-girl.  Although Molly and Frankie are still in love, Frankie's guilt over causing Zosh's paralysis have kept them apart.  Frankie tries to tell Molly that she should leave her current boyfriend, the chiseling, alcoholic Drunkie John, but Molly states that she needs someone to stave off her deep-seated loneliness.  Soon after, Frankie has an interview with Lane, who promises to call him with an audition for a band, but warns him that if he backslides even once, Lane will no longer sponsor him.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nDespite Frankie's happiness, Zosh nags at him that he is being unrealistic in striving for a better life.  A week passes without word from Lane, and Frankie sinks into depression, until one afternoon, Frankie runs into Louie and, succumbing to temptation, accompanies Louie to his apartment for a fix.  Louie gleefully tells Frankie that \"the monkey never dies\" as he injects him with the drug, and Frankie is hooked again.  Later, after yet another quarrel with Zosh, Frankie storms down to Antek's.  There he meets Molly, who encourages him to call Lane, telling him that Lane probably lost his phone number.  Molly proves to be correct, and Lane arranges for Frankie to audition for Shorty Rogers' band on the coming Monday.  Frankie then pleads with Molly to let him practice playing his drums in her room, as the spiteful Zosh has forbidden him to do so in their room.  Although she is reluctant to encourage Frankie's hopes of building a future for the two of them, Molly agrees, and when she comes home early the next morning, he happily greets her.  After bragging that he has quit Schwiefka and joined the musicians' union, Frankie promises Molly that he is going to kick drugs again, and that after he has made some money and can send Zosh to a clinic, they will be together.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Schwiefka and Louie search for Frankie, as they have used Frankie's reputation to lure two big-time gamblers, Markette and Williams, to play in Schwiefka's poker game.  After Zosh urges Frankie to deal the big game and tears up his musicians' union card, Frankie seeks refuge at Antek's, where Louie offers him some of the profits if he will deal for Markette and Williams.  Desperately needing the money, Frankie agrees, and again gives in when Louie tempts him with another fix.  Frankie then goes to the Safari Club, where a disappointed Molly berates him for getting high.  When Frankie gets in a fight with John, Molly hurriedly leaves the neighborhood without telling Frankie where she is going.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nLater, Frankie deals the game for Markette and Williams, and his skill easily enables the house to win.

"Storyline": "During the Gold Rush, prospectors brave Alaska's dangerous Chilkoot Pass, hoping to strike it rich in the snowy mountains. Just as Big Jim McKay discovers gold on his claim, a storm arises, prompting a Lone Prospector to take refuge in a cabin. Unknown to him, the cabin's occupant is desperado Black Larsen, who attempts to throw the vagabond Prospector out. Strong winds, however, repeatedly blow the little man back inside, and soon after, Jim is also swept into the cabin. Jim fights with Larsen over his shotgun, and after Jim prevails, the Prospector claims him as a close friend in order to remain safe. Over the next few days, the three men live together uneasily, their hunger growing as the storm rages on. After eating the lantern candle, with salt, the Prospector worries in vain that Jim has eaten Larsen's little dog. Finally, the men cut cards to see who will hunt for food, and the loser, Larsen, sets out alone. He immediately encounters two lawmen who are searching for him, and after shooting them both, steals their supplies and travels on until he happens upon Jim's claim. Meanwhile, the Prospector and Jim grow so ravenous that they boil and eat the Prospector's leather shoe for Thanksgiving dinner. Unsatiated, Jim starts hallucinating, imagining that the Prospector is a large, luscious chicken. He tries repeatedly to shoot his little friend for dinner, causing the men to fight. The Prospector closes his eyes and attacks, and when he discovers that the leg he is clutching is actually that of a bear, he shoots it, finally providing them with a meal. Soon after, the storm ends and the friends part ways. Upon returning to his claim, Jim finds a well-fed Larsen, who knocks Jim out and flees but is soon killed in an avalanche. The Prospector travels on to Gold Rush City, where he falls in love with Georgia, a dance hall girl. Georgia's flirtation with ladies' man Jack Cameron precludes her from noting the Prospector's existence until finally, hoping to provoke Jack, she chooses the grubby Prospector as a dance partner. The Prospector is thrilled, but cannot help calling attention to himself when his pants fall down and he accidentally belts them with a leash that is still attached to a dog. Later, the Prospector sees Jack and Georgia quarrelling, and although afraid of the much larger man, bravely fights him. When a clock falls on Jack's head and knocks him out, the Prospector, who did not see the clock hit Jack,  is amazed by his own strength. The next morning, the little man obtains food by pretending he is nearly frozen outside Hank Curtis' cabin, prompting the kind man to feed and shelter him. One day, while Hank is away mining, Georgia and her friends happen by his cabin. Georgia discovers her photo under the Prospector's pillow and teases the gullible man by pretending to adore him. Before leaving, the girls accept his invitation to New Year's Eve dinner, after which he rips up his pillows in delight, only to be found covered in feathers by Georgia when she returns for her gloves. Although the Prospector shovels snow for days to earn enough money to prepare a lavish dinner, on New Year's Eve the girls celebrate in the dance hall, leaving the little man waiting in his cabin. He falls asleep at the table and dreams that he is entertaining the girls by creating the illusion of as dance using rolls attached to two forks, but when he wakes, he is alone. He goes to the dance hall, but the girls and Jack have already left for his cabin to tease him further. There, however, Georgia sees the dinner he has prepared and realizes her joke has gone too far. A few days later, Jim, who has partial amnesia and has searched in vain for his rich claim, recognizes the Prospector in the dance hall and joyfully instructs him to lead him to Larsen's cabin, which he knows is near his claim. After the Prospector declares his love to Georgia and promises to return for her, the men journey to the cabin, and while they are asleep, a strong wind pushes the house until it teeters over the edge of a cliff. When they wake, they slowly realize that, by standing at opposite ends of the room, their weight shifts the cabin back and forth over the mountain edge. After multiple attempts, they finally manage to climb out of the house just before it topples over the cliff, only to discover that they are on Jim's claim. The friends are immediately transformed into multimillionaires, and prepare to return to the mainland by boat. Unknown to the Prospector, Georgia is also on the boat, and after a journalist asks the Prospector to don his hobo clothes for a photo shoot, Georgia assumes he is a stowaway and tries to protect him from the ship's guards. Soon, the misunderstanding is cleared up, and the Prospector invites his love to his luxury stateroom, where he \"spoils\" a press photograph by leaning over to kiss her.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

When the gang takes a ski holiday at a Sun Valley lodge run by social director Donald Pevney, Todd and Craig decide to pose as females and flirt with Freddie to discover why the girls find him irresistible. Masquerading as Jane and Nora, the boys join the ladies' ski lessons where Freddie takes notice of the two newcomers. While the enamoured Freddie flirts with them, Todd becomes involved with a Swedish girl, and Craig courts his buxom ski instructor. Pevney provides the group with a show of ski stunts and music. Freddie makes an advance toward Craig disguised as Nora, and he chases the gang through Sawtooth National Forest and back to the heated pools of Los Angeles. Once home, the co-eds realize the joke Todd and Craig have played on Freddie. No longer prey to Freddie's flirtations, the girls find romance with Todd and Craig.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Realizing that he is about to lose his case against Lee Leander, a beautiful shoplifter, assistant district attorney John Sargent foils long-winded defense attorney Francis X. O'Leary's argument to have the case decided quickly so that everyone can go Christmas shopping.  Knowing that convictions, especially against a woman, are almost impossible during the holidays, he moves to adjourn the case until after the beginning of the year. Soon after, his conscience begins to bother him at the thought of Lee spending Christmas in jail, and he posts her bail.  Lee is broke and has nowhere to go, though, and when Jack discovers that she is from Indiana, where he is about to drive to visit his mother for the holidays, he offers to drop her off at home. Enroute, they get disoriented on a country road and get arrested as trespassers, but Lee saves them from jail by starting a fire in the local Justice of the Peace's waste basket.  When they finally make it to Lee's mother's farm, the hateful woman turns her own daughter away, hurting Lee who never could live up to her mother's moralistic code.  Feeling sorry for Lee, Jack brings her home to his mother and Aunt Emma.  Jack secretly tells his mother about Lee and she sympathizes with the girl, whom she recognizes as a victim of a loveless childhood.  Aunt Emma, who doesn't know about Lee's background, enocurages a romance between her and Jack, and they soon fall in love.  On New Year's Eve, before they are to return to New York City, Jack's mother, fearful that a relationship with Lee would destroy her son's career, pleads with her to give him up and Lee agrees.  On the drive home, Jack offers to leave Lee in Canada so that she can avoid prosecution, but, mindful of his mother's plea, Lee insists upon returning to New York.  The trial resumes and the judge, who has seen Jack and Lee together on the evening they left for Indiana, suspects that Jack might try to throw the case.  Hoping to win sympathy for Lee, Jack begins to brow beat her in front of the jury, but Lee, realizing his motives, pleads guilty and is remanded to jail. As she is lead away, Jack proposes to her and she promises that if he still feels that way after she has paid her debt to society, she will marry him.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "When efficiency expert Richard Sumner comes to the research department of the Federal Broadcasting Company to evaluate work patterns, his eccentric behavior piques the curiosity of researchers Peg Costello, Sylvia Blair and Ruthie Saylor. Bunny Watson, the quick-witted, sharp-tongued head researcher, begins to worry when Sumner informs her that he is a methods engineer whose goal is to improve the man-work hour relationship. After observing the department, Sumner confers with Mr. Azae, the head of the network, about computerization, and Azae asks him to keep the project a secret. Meanwhile, Bunny admires a gown she has purchased in the hope that Mike Cutler, her boss and suitor of seven years, will invite her to a country club dance, prompting the wise-cracking Peg to counsel Bunny that she has made herself too available to Mike, who treats her \"like an old coat.\"  Soon after, Mike appears, and after asking Bunny to look over his department financial report, offhandedly invites her to the dance and a weekend in the country.  Afterward, Sumner invites Bunny to lunch and she has visions of dining at a posh hotel until Sumner escorts her to the blustery rooftop of the office building and hands her a sandwich.  Sumner then gives Bunny an ability test, and she astounds him by answering every question perfectly.  Bunny quips that she has researched Sumner and discovered that he is the inventor and patent holder of EMMARAC, an electronic brain.  Impressed, Sumner compliments Bunny by calling her a \"rare tropical fish.\"  After lunch, Bunny pumps Smithers, the office gossip, for information about Sumner. Upon returning to the office, Bunny is breathlessly informed by Peg that Sumner has come to replace them all with his mechanical brain. After Bunny reassures Peg that no machine can do their job, Peg counters that half the payroll department was dismissed after EMMARAC was installed in their division.  As Sumner daily haunts the research department, the team becomes extremely paranoid. On the eve of the big weekend, Mike drops into Bunny's office to break their date because he has been asked to accompany Azae to Chicago as a result of \"his\" exemplary financial report.  At the end of work that afternoon, Bunny and Sumner encounter Smithers in the hallway.  It is storming outside, and consequently, Smithers offers them a ride with his squalling family.  After Smithers drops them off in front of Bunny's apartment building, Bunny invites the soaked Sumner in for dinner and gives him a robe to wear that she has bought as a Christmas gift for Mike. They dine convivially, dressed only in their robes, and when Sumner walks into the kitchen to fetch dessert, Mike rings the doorbell and explains that his plane has been grounded. When Sumner appears, the pompous Mike is shocked to find Bunny entertaining another man.  Peg rings the doorbell next, and when Mike apologizes for his unseemly behavior, Bunny thinks Mike is about to propose, but instead, he disappoints her once again.  At the office Christmas party, the research staff laments the fact that this will be their last office party.  As Peg and Bunny giggle, slightly tipsy from an abundance of champagne, Sumner scrutinizes his budget and Mike returns from Chicago.  When Bunny presents Mike with a set of bongo drums as his Christmas gift, he starts to propose but is summoned to Azae's office.  In Mike's absence, Sumner pounds the drums as Bunny sings. Sparks begin to fly between Bunny and Sumner, and Bunny accuses Sumner of never marrying because he is in love with EMMARAC.  Mike then returns, bubbling with the news that he has been promoted to vice president.  When Mike announces that he and Bunny will leave for the coast on Tuesday to be married, Bunny makes excuses about why she cannot possibly leave New York, and Mike accuses Bunny of being involved with Sumner and angrily storms out of the office.  Sumner then merrily invites the entire office for a drink, but the air of congeniality is shattered when the coldly efficient, condescending Miss Warringer arrives from Sumner's office to arrange for the installation of EMMARAC.  Soon after, EMMARAC arrives, overseen by Miss Warringer and her many prohibitions. When their pay envelopes arrive stuffed with pink dismissal slips, the staff sadly begins to pack up their desks and refuse to answer the phones, which are ringing off their hooks with research questions, forcing the befuddled Miss Warringer to deal with the onslaught of calls.  Sumner is puzzled by the staff's lack of cooperation, and after EMMARAC goes berserk, Miss Warringer breaks down in hysterics and runs screaming from the office.  After receiving his pink slip, Sumner discovers that the entire building has been fired by the payroll computer.  Sumner then explains that EMMARAC was never intended to replace the research department, only to help them do their job, but the project was kept secret because of an impending merger  with another network. After Sumner teaches Bunny to use EMMARAC, she fondly pats the machine. When Mike, bearing roses, enters Bunny's office, Sumner calls her out of the room and asks EMMARAC if Bunny should marry Mike or him.  Asserting that EMMARAC would always come first in Sumner's life, Bunny pushes the destruct button to prove her point.  As Mike leaves the roses on Bunny's desk and silently departs, Sumner repairs EMMARAC and then hugs Bunny.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Luckily for him he receives a clue that this is going to occur and diverts most of the cash into his own safety deposit box, leaving only a nominal amount for the crook (Christopher Plummer). The ruse works well, but for the fact that the crook resents the fact that he has been outsmarted. There ensues a terrific battle of wits involving the clever but basically \"moral\" teller, and the cunning and totally uninhibited bank robber, which involves several other people in ways which cannot be revealed here.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Prompted by the sentiment of Christmas, reformed safecracker Boston Blackie persuades the cast of a musical comedy company to help him entertain the inmates at his \"alma mater,\" the state prison.  The stars of the troupe are Roggi McKay, the famous clown, and a young dancer, Eve Sands, whose brother, Joe Trilby, is an inmate at the institution.  Eve is anxious to see her brother, who was jailed on false evidence and who now he seeks revenge on Duke Banton and cab driver Steve Caveroni, the two men who framed him.  To make sure that Blackie and his sidekick, The Runt, do not cause any trouble, Inspector Farraday and Detective Mathews accompany them on the bus trip to the prison.  While the prisoners and guards are watching the performance, Joe overpowers Roggi in a backstage office and changes into the clown's clothes and makeup.  When the show ends, Joe, posing as Roggi, boards the bus with the rest of the troupe and returns to the city.  Back at the theater, Blackie and Eve discover Joe's deception, but he escapes.  Trailing the fugitive to Eve's hotel, Blackie tries to dissuade him from his scheme to kill Duke and Caveroni. Joe refuses to listen, however, and at gunpoint, he takes Blackie's clothes, leaving him bound and gagged.  Soon after, Eve returns home and frees Blackie. After Blackie puts on the clown suit, he and Eve return to his apartment. There he tells Runt to call Jumbo Madigan, a fence, to find out Duke's address. Meanwhile, the police have discovered Joe's prison break and hurry to question Blackie.  When Farraday tries to arrest Blackie, he and Runt escape.  Hoping to warn Joe's victims, Blackie goes to Duke's hotel, whose address he obtained from Jumbo, and he finds Duke shot to death. Minutes later Joe arrives, angry over being cheated of his revenge.  When the police pound at the door, Runt and Blackie hide Joe under the couch, and he later escapes by changing places with Duke's body, which is under a sheet covering a stretcher.  Blackie manages to hide Duke's body in a folding bed before Farraday arrests him and takes him to headquarters.  Outwitting his guards, Blackie makes a break from the police station with Eve and goes to meet Joe, who is hiding at the mansion owned by Arthur Manleder, Blackie's eccentric millionaire friend.  Blackie traces the cab driver's license that he found at the scene of Duke's murder to Caveroni. Setting a trap for Caveroni, Blackie instructs Eve to hail Caveroni's cab and take it to the hotel where Duke's body is hidden.  Eve asks Caveroni to carry her bag to her room, and when he opens the door, he is met by Blackie, who confronts him with the corpse and accuses him of murder.  Meanwhile, Farraday returns to the hotel, alerted by the ambulance driver's report of a missing corpse.  Outside the hotel room door, Farraday listens as Caveroni confesses to killing Duke because Duke was planning to frame him and admits that he and Duke framed Joe.  Trying to escape, Caveroni runs out the door, takes the elevator to the lobby and jumps in his cab, but is shot by the police. Joe is cleared of all charges, and at a Christmas party, he toasts Blackie and Farraday as the \"two best cops in the world.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Although she frequently donates large sums of money to charities, the fact that she is actually penniless is concealed from her by her staff of faithful domestics. Her well-mannered but larcenous butler, Fitzwilliam (or Fitzwilly, as he is called by his friends), has been able to run Miss Vickie's household in the black and keep ahead of her charitable contributions by organizing the other servants into a ring of smalltime crooks. One day Miss Vickie hires a part-time secretary, Juliet Nowell, to help with the dictionary she is writing for people who can't spell. Although Juliet inevitably catches on to Fitzwilly's maneuvers, she finds herself too attracted to him to notify the police. Events reach a climax when one of Miss Vickie's over-generous contributions escapes Fitzwilly's attention, and drastic measures are called for to cover the deficit. With the reluctant help of Juliet, an elaborate plan is worked out to rob Gimbel's department store on Christmas Eve. Miss Vickie's staff joins in the caper, and everything goes off on schedule, with the haul amounting to $190,000. One small hitch develops, however, when Albert, the conscience-stricken footman, confesses to the police. Since Albert refuses to name his accomplices, Miss Vickie is summoned. Unperturbed, she volunteers to write Gimbel's a check for $190,000, thereby leaving the frustrated Fitzwilly with no choice but to deposit the stolen money in Miss Vickie's bank account. But all ends happily when Miss Vickie announces that she has sold her unique dictionary, much of which is an amusing biography of her late father, to a movie producer for $500,000.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Unperturbed, she volunteers to write Gimbel's a check for $190,000, thereby leaving the frustrated Fitzwilly with no choice but to deposit the stolen money in Miss Vickie's bank account. But all ends happily when Miss Vickie announces that she has sold her unique dictionary, much of which is an amusing biography of her late father, to a movie producer for $500,000.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "When efficiency expert Richard Sumner comes to the research department of the Federal Broadcasting Company to evaluate work patterns, his eccentric behavior piques the curiosity of researchers Peg Costello, Sylvia Blair and Ruthie Saylor. Bunny Watson, the quick-witted, sharp-tongued head researcher, begins to worry when Sumner informs her that he is a methods engineer whose goal is to improve the man-work hour relationship. After observing the department, Sumner confers with Mr. Azae, the head of the network, about computerization, and Azae asks him to keep the project a secret. Meanwhile, Bunny admires a gown she has purchased in the hope that Mike Cutler, her boss and suitor of seven years, will invite her to a country club dance, prompting the wise-cracking Peg to counsel Bunny that she has made herself too available to Mike, who treats her \"like an old coat.\"  Soon after, Mike appears, and after asking Bunny to look over his department financial report, offhandedly invites her to the dance and a weekend in the country.  Afterward, Sumner invites Bunny to lunch and she has visions of dining at a posh hotel until Sumner escorts her to the blustery rooftop of the office building and hands her a sandwich.  Sumner then gives Bunny an ability test, and she astounds him by answering every question perfectly.  Bunny quips that she has researched Sumner and discovered that he is the inventor and patent holder of EMMARAC, an electronic brain.  Impressed, Sumner compliments Bunny by calling her a \"rare tropical fish.\"  After lunch, Bunny pumps Smithers, the office gossip, for information about Sumner. Upon returning to the office, Bunny is breathlessly informed by Peg that Sumner has come to replace them all with his mechanical brain. After Bunny reassures Peg that no machine can do their job, Peg counters that half the payroll department was dismissed after EMMARAC was installed in their division.  As Sumner daily haunts the research department, the team becomes extremely paranoid. On the eve of the big weekend, Mike drops into Bunny's office to break their date because he has been asked to accompany Azae to Chicago as a result of \"his\" exemplary financial report.  At the end of work that afternoon, Bunny and Sumner encounter Smithers in the hallway.  It is storming outside, and consequently, Smithers offers them a ride with his squalling family.  After Smithers drops them off in front of Bunny's apartment building, Bunny invites the soaked Sumner in for dinner and gives him a robe to wear that she has bought as a Christmas gift for Mike. They dine convivially, dressed only in their robes, and when Sumner walks into the kitchen to fetch dessert, Mike rings the doorbell and explains that his plane has been grounded. When Sumner appears, the pompous Mike is shocked to find Bunny entertaining another man.  Peg rings the doorbell next, and when Mike apologizes for his unseemly behavior, Bunny thinks Mike is about to propose, but instead, he disappoints her once again.  At the office Christmas party, the research staff laments the fact that this will be their last office party.  As Peg and Bunny giggle, slightly tipsy from an abundance of champagne, Sumner scrutinizes his budget and Mike returns from Chicago.  When Bunny presents Mike with a set of bongo drums as his Christmas gift, he starts to propose but is summoned to Azae's office.  In Mike's absence, Sumner pounds the drums as Bunny sings. Sparks begin to fly between Bunny and Sumner, and Bunny accuses Sumner of never marrying because he is in love with EMMARAC.  Mike then returns, bubbling with the news that he has been promoted to vice president.  When Mike announces that he and Bunny will leave for the coast on Tuesday to be married, Bunny makes excuses about why she cannot possibly leave New York, and Mike accuses Bunny of being involved with Sumner and angrily storms out of the office.  Sumner then merrily invites the entire office for a drink, but the air of congeniality is shattered when the coldly efficient, condescending Miss Warringer arrives from Sumner's office to arrange for the installation of EMMARAC.  Soon after, EMMARAC arrives, overseen by Miss Warringer and her many prohibitions. When their pay envelopes arrive stuffed with pink dismissal slips, the staff sadly begins to pack up their desks and refuse to answer the phones, which are ringing off their hooks with research questions, forcing the befuddled Miss Warringer to deal with the onslaught of calls.  Sumner is puzzled by the staff's lack of cooperation, and after EMMARAC goes berserk, Miss Warringer breaks down in hysterics and runs screaming from the office.  After receiving his pink slip, Sumner discovers that the entire building has been fired by the payroll computer.  Sumner then explains that EMMARAC was never intended to replace the research department, only to help them do their job, but the project was kept secret because of an impending merger  with another network. After Sumner teaches Bunny to use EMMARAC, she fondly pats the machine. When Mike, bearing roses, enters Bunny's office, Sumner calls her out of the room and asks EMMARAC if Bunny should marry Mike or him.  Asserting that EMMARAC would always come first in Sumner's life, Bunny pushes the destruct button to prove her point.  As Mike leaves the roses on Bunny's desk and silently departs, Sumner repairs EMMARAC and then hugs Bunny.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The Bishop's Wife",
"Storyline": "During the Christmas season, Dudley, an angel in the guise of a mortal, strolls around a small town and notices Julia Brougham, the bishop's wife, gazing wistfully through a store window.  Dudley follows Julia to a Christmas tree lot, where she meets her old friend, Professor Wutheridge, and expresses her sadness that her husband Henry is too busy worrying about fund raising for a new cathedral to enjoy the season with his parishioners.  The professor offers Julia a contribution of an ancient Roman coin from his collection.  After Julia leaves for home, Dudley purposely bumps into the professor and makes inquiries about the Broughams.  When Julia arrives home, she finds Henry in a tense meeting with several important parishioners, including Mrs. Agnes Hamilton, a wealthy widow, who insists that her large contribution toward the cathedral's construction guarantee a proper memorial to her dead husband.  Henry is upset by Julia's tardiness and the meeting breaks up after Mrs. Hamilton threatens to withdraw her support unless satisfied. Julia mentions seeing the professor and gives Henry the ancient coin, which he angrily dismisses as worthless.  Trying to make amends for his curtness, Henry asks Julia to have lunch with him the following day as they used to do, and she delightedly agrees.  After retiring to his study, however, Henry is beset by messages and demands on his time.  Dismissing his assistant, Mildred Cassaway, Henry prays for guidance, and a few moments later, Dudley mysteriously arrives and informs Henry that he is an angel sent in answer to his prayer.  Henry is immediately skeptical, and when Julia comes in a few moments later, Dudley introduces himself as Henry's assistant, which pleases her and upsets Henry. The next morning Henry is dismayed to see that Dudley has returned and ingratiated himself with Mildred Cassaway, the maid, Matilda, and even the family dog, Queenie.  Julia is disappointed that Henry has broken their luncheon date and sadly takes their young daughter Debby to the park.  After Henry departs, Dudley follows Julia and Debby to the park and helps the little girl build her confidence during a snowball fight.  Dudley offers to take Julia to lunch just as Matilda inexplicably shows up to relieve her of Debby. Dudley takes Julia to Michel's, which she reveals is her favorite restaurant and is where Henry proposed to her. When they are spotted by several parish ladies, Dudley wards off gossip by inviting them to join him and Julia. Walking home later, Julia and Dudley run into the professor, who is suspicious of Dudley, yet invites them to his tiny apartment, where he admits that due to a lack of inspiration he has not worked for some time on his manuscript about ancient Rome.  Dudley, who has retrieved the ancient coin from the Brougahms', returns it to the professor and piques his interest by informing him of the rare and valuable coin's unique history.  Meanwhile, Henry has rescheduled his appointments so that he can make his lunch date with Julia and is annoyed to discover that she has gone out with Dudley.  The next day, Dudley tells Debby the story of David, who is helped by an angel, which only vexes Henry further. Later, Henry accepts an appointment to meet with Mrs. Hamilton, knowing it will conflict with his promised appearance at choir practice at his old parish. Despite Julia's pleas, Henry insists on seeing Mrs. Hamilton, and Dudley accompanies Julia to the rehearsal.  At Mrs. Hamilton's, Henry agrees to all her demands in exchange for her complete support of the cathedral but, while hastening to leave to meet Julia, finds himself stuck to a recently varnished chair.  At the church, meanwhile, Rev. Miller is embarrassed by the poor turnout, but Dudley reassures him and asks the couple of boys present to begin singing. Gradually all the boys arrive and give an inspiring performance under Dudley's direction.  As the still-stuck Henry fumes at Mrs. Hamilton's, Dudley and Julia catch a cab into town where Dudley purchases a hat for Julia he knows she admires.  Then Dudley asks the cab driver, Sylvester, to stop at a park where a crowd is ice skating and, with Dudley's guidance, both Julia and Sylvester skate enthusiastically.  Dudley and Julia return home, where Henry angrily demands that Dudley leave for good.  Henry's outburst depresses Julia, and the next day, Christmas Eve, the household wonders if Dudley will ever return.  After Henry and Julia leave to make calls, Dudley arrives and rewrites Henry's Christmas sermon, dictating while the typewriter takes down the new speech.  Dudley then transforms the Christmas tree over which Matilda has been laboring and departs to see Mrs. Hamilton.  While waiting in the wealthy woman's drawing room, Dudley discovers a hidden piece of sheet music inscribed to Mrs. Hamilton from a man who is not her husband.  Dudley plays the tune on Mrs. Hamilton's harp, and she confesses that in her youth she was in love with the tune's composer, but feared poverty and rejected him.  In an effort to make up for not loving her wealthy husband, she has steadfastly tried to maintain his legacy. Later, when Henry and Julia arrive, Mrs. Hamilton thanks Henry for sending Dudley to her and tells them that he has inspired her to give her money to the needy rather than build the cathedral.  Utterly dismayed, Henry tells Julia he will meet her at home and, wandering into town, stops by the professor's, where he confides that Dudley is an angel who has upset everything. He apologizes for rejecting the professor's coin, which the old scholar returns to him, declaring that it has inspired him and may help Henry too.  When Henry sadly reveals he believes he has lost Julia to Dudley, the professor reminds him that he is human and Dudley is not and encourages him to fight for Julia.  At the Broughams' home, while Dudley and Julia stand admiring the Christmas tree, Dudley tells her it is time for him to leave, but asks her to have him stay. Disturbed by his implication, Julia tells him that he must go and hastens upstairs just as Henry arrives to challenge Dudley. Dudley is pleased that Henry has finally acknowledged that Julia is the most important thing in his life and reminds the bishop that he never prayed for a cathedral, but for guidance.  He wistfully adds that it is bad when an angel envies a mortal and informs Henry that after he goes, no one will have any memory of his existence.  Henry then finds himself alone in his study praying before the painting of the cathedral, and abruptly races upstairs looking for Julia, who is putting Debby to bed.  They embrace and then depart for St. Timothy's where Henry delivers Dudley's Christmas sermon.  Dudley listens from the street, and satisfied, departs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "On Christmas Eve, 1895, on French-controlled Devil's Island, where trustees of the penal colony are allowed to roam free, three escaped convicts¿swindler Joseph and murderers Albert and Jules¿plot ways to board a Paris-bound ship anchored offshore.  Penniless and still wearing their prison garb, the convicts are approached by Arnaud, the ship's young medical officer, who asks for directions.  While chatting with Arnaud, Jules, a former safecracker, picks his pockets and inadvertently steals a letter addressed to Felix Ducotel, the local general store proprietor.  The three decide to deliver the letter, and rob the store, and are delighted when the absent-minded, kindly Felix assumes they are convict laborers and hires them to fix his leaky roof.  Once on the roof, the convicts eavesdrop on Felix and his wife Amelie as they discuss Felix's cousin, Andre Trochard, the store's owner.  Amelie despises Andre for using his wealth to control the financially strapped Felix and threatening to fire him if the store fails to show a profit.  Amelie also bemoans the fact that their impressionable eighteen-year-old daughter Isabelle is in love with Paul, Andre's nephew and heir, who lives in Paris with his uncle, as she knows that Andre will never approve the match.  When Isabelle asks her father about the still unopened letter, Felix realizes it is from Andre and panics.  After reading that Andre has been quarantined on the ship and is demanding that Felix secure his release, Felix scurries to the dock.  Isabelle then reads the letter and faints.  Seeing her prostrate, the convicts jump down from the roof and also read the letter.  The men explain to a bemused Amelie that Isabelle fainted upon reading Andre's announcement that Paul is to marry the daughter of a rich business acquaintance.  While young Albert carries the unconscious Isabelle to her room, Joseph blithely talks a bald man into buying an expensive comb and brush set from the store and inspects Felix's account books.  Although Jules and Albert begin to question their plan to rob and kill the Ducotels, Joseph insists they need money to escape.  Joseph proceeds to sell an expensive coat for Felix, and Felix and Amelie, touched by the convicts' apparent concern, invite them for Christmas Eve dinner.  Joseph then dashes out and steals a turkey and other items for the meal, while Albert, who was jailed for killing his uncle over money, encourages Isabelle not to give up on Paul.  Buoyed by Albert's flattery, Isabelle tells the convicts they are like the three angels on her favorite Christmas tree decoration.  That night after dinner, a grateful Felix gives the men some cash, and Albert and Jules again wonder if they can go through with their plan.  Just then, Andre and Paul show up, having been released from the ship, and Andre declares that he has come to inspect Felix's books and check the store's inventory.  Before retiring, the snide and suspicious Andre also tells Felix that Isabelle, who he assumes is after his money, cannot marry Paul.  After lying to Andre that the store is making money, Joseph begs Felix to allow him to fix the books to show a profit.  Felix is about to agree when Andre reappears, demanding to check the books that night.  Although Joseph and Jules are now ready to give up and leave, Albert convinces them to stay to help Isabelle with Paul.  Joseph forges a note from Paul to Isabelle, begging her to meet him in the garden, then he and Jules cajole Paul into talking to her.  Isabelle tries to convince Paul to defy his uncle and marry her, but as soon as Andre catches them together and orders Paul to look at Felix's books, the spineless Paul acquiesces.  Infuriated by Andre's accusations and bullying, the convicts conduct a mock trial, and Joseph condemns Andre to death.  Joseph immediately changes his mind, but just then, Andre bursts in, yelling about missing store inventory.  Andre grabs a decorative box he believes Albert has stolen and retreats to his bedroom, dismissing Albert's warning that the box contains his poisonous pet viper Adolphe.  Feeling that fate has intervened, the convicts make no further moves until morning.  The next day, after entering Andre's bedroom and finding him dead from a snake bite, Joseph forges a will leaving half of Andre's estate to Felix and tries to get various family members to discover the body.  At the same time, Albert and Jules search all over for the now missing Adolphe.  Paul finally finds his uncle's body and, barely hiding his glee, burns Joseph's forged will, thereby assuring he will inherit everything.  Paul then returns to his uncle's room and is bitten by Adolphe, who was hiding in Andre's pocket.  The convicts escort the dying Paul to the summer house, where he is later discovered by Isabelle.  At that moment, officer Arnaud, representing the board of health, arrives, having been summoned by Amelie and Felix.  After making sure that Isabelle and the handsome Arnaud meet, the convicts steal some suits and bid the Ducotels farewell.  At the dock, however, they realize they have become a little too \"angelic\" to escape, conclude they would soon be caught any way and head back to prison.                      \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Because of her known addiction to mystery novels, the debutante is unable to convince the police that she witnessed a crime, and decides to begin her own investigation.  After viewing a newsreel in which Waring is reported to have died accidentally while decorating a Christmas tree at his Long Island estate, Nicki sneaks onto the property, only to be discovered by Arnold Waring, Joseah's nephew.  Arnold, however, mistakes Nicki for Margo Martin, a nightclub singer and Joseah's fiancée.  Posing as Margo, Nicki is then allowed to witness the reading of Joseah's will, in which the tycoon disinherits his family and leaves the bulk of his estate to Margo.  Later, while searching Joseah's room, Nicki finds the bloody slippers the tycoon was wearing when he was killed, but Mr. Saunders, Waring's personal secretary, sends Danny, a chauffeur, to Nicki's hotel room to recover the incriminating evidence.  Nicki then goes to The Circus Club to see Margo, but when Arnold shows up, Nicki is forced to lock the singer in her dressing room and perform in her place.  Nicki is later waylaid by Saunders and Danny, but she is soon rescued by mystery writer Wayne Morgan, at the cost of his engagement to long-time fiancée, Joyce Williams. Saunders is then killed, allowing Nicki and Wayne to sneak out of the nightclub with the slippers.  The two are arrested the next morning for the nightclub murder, and evidence of their innocence is destroyed when Maxwell, Wayne's valet, cleans Joseah's bloody slippers. Nicki is later bailed out of jail by Arnold, but she runs away as she suspects him of the murders.  She then mistakenly seeks the protection of Jonathan Waring, Arnold's older brother, unaware that he is the psychopathic killer. Nicki suddenly realizes the truth when she discovers that she is in the same room in which Joseah was killed. Jonathan tells Nicki that he plans to kill her, then frame his brother for the murder.  Arnold manages to rescue Nicki, only to have Wayne arrive, mistake him for the killer and give Jonathan back his gun.  Wayne is followed to the Waring warehouse by the police, however, and Jonathan is finally arrested.  Later, Nicki and Wayne marry, and the writer is forced to tell his new bride the ending of his latest book in order to begin their honeymoon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Ma and Pa Kettle at Home",
"Storyline": "During winter in Cape Flattery, Washington, Elwin Kettle, one of Ma and Pa Kettle's fourteen children, and his girl friend, Sally Maddocks, both win a <I>   National Magazine   </I> essay contest entitled \"My Life on a Typical American Farm.\" Unfortunately, Elwin lied in his essay in order to glorify the farm, and the judges plan to visit both farms before deciding to whom the four-year college scholarship prize should be awarded. The prize is to be given on the basis of who provides the best environment for rearing children. The Kettles, concerned that their ramshackle farm cannot compare to neighbor John Maddocks' estate, set out to improve the homestead in the few days before the judges arrive. Pa spends Elwin's initial one hundred dollars in prize money on Maddocks' cranky goats, which immediately wreck the house. He then buys supplies on credit at Billy Reed's store, and puts his Native American friends, Geoduck and Crowbar, to work whitewashing the shed. Over the next few days, everyone toils furiously while lazy Pa naps and directs their work. Afraid of wasting supplies, Pa instructs Geoduck and Crowbar to construct a makeshift machinery shed, smokehouse and silo out of cardboard, and borrows equipment, animals and a tractor from their neighbors. By the time the judges, hypochondriac magazine editor Mannering and ex-farmer photographer Pete Crosby, arrive, the farm looks impressive, from a distance. Ma and Pa are trying on a corset and slip from a traveling saleswoman when Mannering appears, and immediately horrify the persnickety editor, who is further dismayed by the rustic accommodations. At lunch, the family attempts to be proper. Although Pete loves Ma's home cooking, Mannering wants only melba toast. Later, they try to dissuade Mannering from inspecting the farm, succeeding when the Kettle bull, Nick, takes off after Maddocks' cow Bessie, and everyone chases it. The next morning, Ma drags Mannering to the measly \"orchard\" and then pushes him into the pig sty in order to keep him from noticing that the buildings are cardboard. When he then tries to take a bath, little Billy Kettle deposits a frog in his tub. At night, Pete, who has discerned the ruse, tells Ma that it does not take money to be a good parent, and watches as the children recite their prayers in unison. The next day, Geoduck and Crowbar, whom Mannering assumes are wild Indians, scare him away from the buildings, but that night, a heavy rain washes all the cardboard and white paint away. Mannering wakes to find the farm as derelict as ever, and storms to the Maddocks' in protest. There, Mannering and Pete witness Maddocks' rough treatment of his wife and daughter, but admire his fine farm. Soon after, Pa devises a plan to impress Mannering and hires Geoduck's friends to pose as wild Indians so Pa can appear to be a hero. While Pa brings Mannering and Pete into the woods to cut down a Christmas tree, Geoduck urges his friends to apply \"Indian\" costumes and makeup, though they declare that it would be easier to send Elwin to college themselves than to put up with the indignity. The Indians \"attack,\" following the wagon even after Pa accidentally rushes it onto the main highway. There, the police stop them, and Pa is forced to confess his plot. Mannering is more furious than ever, but Ma convinces him to attend their Christmas party the following night. Before he, Pete and the Maddocks leave their farm, Mannering watches as Maddocks refuses to give his wife or daughter any presents. At the Kettles', the house is warm, cozy and full of gifts, guests and children. Ma reads a poem that gently teases everyone present, and later Pa appears as Santa Claus, the children sing carols, and Pa hands out gifts. Mannering, upon seeing that Geoduck and Crowbar have given him a headdress, shakes their hands. Ma has wrapped her treasured prize-winning quilts into gifts, pretending they are from Mr. Maddocks to his wife and Sally. When Maddocks sees their delight, he realizes he has been amiss in not buying them presents, and announces that he is withdrawing Sally from the contest. Mannering, however, states that this would be unfair, and instead decides to split the award between the two kids, giving each a two-year scholarship. When Pete then suggests that the town form a 4-H group so children can raise money for college, Maddocks agrees to fund the club. Caught up in the spirit, Pa declares he will soon fix up the farm for real--as soon as Geoduck and Crowbar find the time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Lili",
"Storyline": "In a small French town, the recently orphaned Lili Daurier arrives at the local bakery, only to discover that the owner, who had promised her father he would give her a job, died the previous month.  The proprietor of the general store takes the destitute young woman in, but promptly makes a pass at her.  At that moment, Marc, a member of a traveling carnival, comes into the shop to buy handkerchiefs and helps Lili get away.  Lili then follows the debonair Marc and his friends, puppeteers Paul Berthalet and Jacquot, back to the carnival grounds, and begs Marc to let her stay with him.  Marc gets Lili a job as a waitress at the carnival's cabaret, and that night, Lili watches, enchanted, as Marc performs his magic act, assisted by his glamorous partner Rosalie.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nLili is fired for neglecting her job, however, and when Marc offers no sympathy, she considers jumping off the acrobats' ladder.  She is stopped by Paul, who speaks to her from behind the puppet stage and improvises a show with his puppets to cheer her up.  The other carnival workers slowly gather to watch as Lili converses and sings with Paul's alter ego, the puppet Carrot Top. Recognizing the audience appeal of Lili's innocent charm, Paul and Jacquot incorporate her into their act.  When he is not speaking through his puppets, however, Paul, who is jealous of Lili's infatuation with Marc, treats her coldly.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nLili privately asks Jacquot why Paul is so angry, and he explains that the puppeteer had been a famous dancer before his leg was injured in the war. The new puppet act is a great success, but Paul remains tortured by his feelings for Lili.  One day, Lili is devastated to learn that Marc is leaving the carnival to take a job with a fine hotel. That night, Rosalie tells Marc that she refuses to go on keeping their marriage a secret.  Marc leaves their trailer to escape her nagging, and Lili offers him coffee in the trailer that she shares with Paul and Jacquot.  Marc flirts with Lili and is about to kiss her when Paul comes in.  After Marc leaves, Paul berates Lili viciously.  Lili notices that Marc has left his wedding ring behind and tries to run after him, but Paul misunderstands her intentions and slaps her.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nLater, Paul is approached by Tonit and Enrique, who have been observing his act.  Tonit, who recognizes Paul as the former dancer, offers him an engagement with Les Follies Paris.  Paul is genuinely moved because Tonit praised his work as a puppeteer before learning about his injury, but Jacquot, who has come in with news for Paul, says they will have to consider the offer. After Tonit and Enrique leave, Jacquot tells Paul that Lili is leaving because of his cruel treatment. Meanwhile, Lili returns Marc's wedding ring and, after reproaching herself for her foolishness, says goodbye to the magician and his wife with great dignity. Lili prepares to leave, but as she walks by the puppet theater, Carrot Top calls out and begs her to stay.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThrough the puppets, Paul expresses his affection, but when Lili suddenly pushes aside the curtains, he resumes his usual gruff manner.  Lili sadly sets off on foot, but after walking a good distance, she realizes that the spirit behind the puppets she loves is Paul's. She runs back to the carnival and joins Paul in a joyful embrace as the puppets applaud.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "At Christmas time in San Francisco, Joe Miracle steals $100,000 from the River Club, which he used to own.  After evading his pursuers, Joe hides out with Victor Christopher, the brother of his dead partner Leo, and Victor's wife Clara.  Clara has purchased a berth for Joe on the next ship leaving the city.  The ship, however, will not depart until the following night.  While Joe is trying to decide where he will hide until then, the police demand to search the apartment.  At first Joe believes they are looking for the stolen money, but learns that they want to arrest Victor for disturbing the peace and beating Clara.  When the police mistake Joe for Victor and arrest him for the night, Joe believes that his problems are solved, but Jenny Jones, a social worker, persuades the judge to give Joe a suspended sentence.  Joe then suggests that he stay at the settlement house until he can control his urge to beat Clara.  Later Joe telephones Clara and asks her to bring him the stolen money.  While Joe is hanging Christmas decorations, a group of teenagers talk him into a dice game.  Joe wins from the boys the money they were supposed to spend on a Christmas tree. Later, he secretly returns the money to Jenny's desk, leaving the boys to figure out a solution to their problem. Joe then hides the stolen money in the gym.  After the boys cut down a tree from the park, Jenny persuades the police not to press charges against them, but is angry that Joe gambled with them.  Then, when Joe accidentally falls on the piano and breaks it, she is ready to ask him to leave.  Her attitude softens a little, however, when she discovers the returned money in her desk.  Later, Joe visits a piano store that is actually a front for a bookie operation and coerces the owner into providing a free piano to replace the broken one. While at the store, Joe is spotted by newspaper columnist \"Early\" Byrd, who follows him to the settlement house and questions Jenny about him.  After the janitor finds a gun hidden in Joe's mattress, Jenny reveals that she knows Joe's real identity and asks him to leave.  When he objects, Jenny shows him her hearing aid and tells him about her abusive father, whose beatings made her deaf. Their discussion is interrupted by the delivery of new towels, sheets, blankets and several bathtubs--all arranged by Joe. Joe, who has gone to his room to pack, finds Byrd waiting for him, and from him learns that Leo was killed by the syndicate when he refused to sell the River Club while Joe was in the Army. Just before he leaves, Joe accompanies Jenny to visit some poor Polish-Americans.  He asks Jenny to leave the country with him, but before she can make a decision, the syndicate, alerted by Byrd, corners him and demands that he return the stolen money.  Although Jenny begs Joe to comply, he insists that the money is rightfully his.  The gangsters then start a fire in the settlement house and are able to retrieve the money in the confusion, but the building burns to the ground. Later, Joe sneaks into the River Club and forces Barney Teener, the boss, to replace the money taken by his friends. Then, disguised as Santa Claus, Joe donates the entire amount to the settlement house building fund.  As he leaves, Joe is shot by a gang member.  Jenny rushes to him, and both realize that after he recovers, they will spend their lives together.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Every Girl Should Be Married",
"Storyline": "Single salesclerk Anabel Sims yearns to become a devoted wife and mother, but bemoans the social restrictions forced upon women during courtship.  While discussing the matter at a soda fountain with her girl friend, Julie Howard, Anabel sees Dr. Madison W. Brown and is immediately taken with him.  By coincidence, Anabel meets Madison again when he comes to buy baby booties at Sanford's, the department store where she works.  After determining that Madison is a doctor and unmarried, Anabel shows up at his office claiming to be ill, unaware that he is a pediatrician.  Although Madison, a confirmed bachelor, discourages her interest in him, Anabel determines to trap the doctor and begins researching his life in detail. Feeling that the only way to win Madison is to make him jealous, Anabel poses as her employer Roger Sanford's secretary and makes a reservation under his name at Pierre's, a restaurant she knows Madison frequents.  In an expensive gown she has borrowed from Sanford's dress department, Anabel then coaxes Madison to join her at Roger's table and pretends that she is waiting for her rich lover.  Madison is not fooled, however, and demands to know why she is chasing him.  After the quick-thinking Anabel claims that she is merely using him to make Roger jealous, Roger unexpectedly arrives.  To her relief, Roger, who is an old college friend of Madison's, pretends to know Anabel, and she confesses her entire scheme to him. Roger, a notorious playboy, assumes that Anabel's confession is a ruse to attract him and takes her home.  The next day, Anabel, who has been demoted for rejecting Roger's advances, spies Madison on the street and kisses Roger, who also happens to be walking by, to make him jealous.  Madison is unimpressed, but the kiss is captured on film by a photographer and makes headlines the next morning.  While Roger accuses Anabel of trying to blackmail him, she condemns him as a womanizer.  Later, she is offered a free car from an insurance salesman, who is eager to capitalize on her supposed relation to the store tycoon.  Using the situation to her advantage, Anabel finagles a rent-free month in a model house by insinuating that Roger might invest in the development.  Madison then hears from his barber, masseur and the clerk who sells him tobacco that, despite the rumors, Anabel is really in love with another man.  Seeing through her latest ploy, Madison finds Anabel at the soda fountain and informs her that her maneuvers are failing.  Undaunted, Anabel shows up at a lecture given by Madison and, in front of a supportive, all-female crowd, condemns him for selfishly resisting marriage.  When his hostile reaction to Anabel's words causes some of his patients to cancel their appointments, a fed-up Madison calls Anabel and arranges to have dinner with her. Although Anabel lovingly prepares Madison's favorite foods, the equally determined Madison tells her that he does not love her and advises her to go back home to Joe, her hometown sweetheart.  Anabel is crushed by Madison's defiant rejection and is unprepared for Roger's sudden renewed interest in her. Roger, a three-time divorcé, proposes to Anabel, claiming that her reaction to Madison's rejection has kindled a competitive flame in him. Still dazed, Anabel turns down the proposal, but invites the lovestruck Roger for dinner.  Julie then tells Madison that Anabel is running to Roger \"on the rebound\" and advises him to intervene before Anabel makes a foolish mistake. Although suspicious, Madison shows up at Anabel's and confronts Roger about his \"intentions.\" Before long, Joe suddenly arrives at the house, announcing that he and Anabel are soon marrying.  Madison at first rejoices at the news, but later tells Anabel that she should marry Joe only if she truly loves him.  After announcing to sincere bumpkin Joe that Anabel pursued him relentlessly, Madison surprises himself by proposing to her.  Seeing Anabel's obvious love for the doctor, Joe bids the couple a noble goodbye.  As soon as he is out the door, however, Madison reveals that he knows that \"Joe\" is really radio performer Harry Proctor and praises Anabel for her ingenuity.  He then welcomes the minister whom Anabel had summoned in anticipation of her success and sits down to discuss their wedding plans.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Come to the Stable",
"Storyline": "One winter's night, two French nuns, Sisters Margaret and Scolastica, come to the small New England town of Bethlehem, where they meet Amelia Potts, a painter of religious pictures. After the Sisters announce that they have come to build a hospital there, Chicago-born Sister Margaret explains that during the war she was in charge of a children's hospital in Normandy when it became a potential target during a military campaign. As many of the children could not be evacuated, Sister Margaret made a personal plea to an American general not to shell the hospital which, the Germans were using as an observation post. The hospital was spared but at the cost of American lives, and Sister Margaret made a promise to God that, in gratitude for saving the children, she would return to America to build a children's hospital there. When Miss Potts is puzzled as to why they chose Bethlehem, Sister Margaret replies that they had received a postcard with a reproduction of a nativity scene painted by Miss Potts, entitled \"Come to the Stable,\" and information about the Bethlehem area. The Sisters then decide that a local hill depicted in another of Miss Pott's paintings would be a good site for the hospital. After composer Bob Mason, who is Miss Potts's neighbor, tells the Sisters that the hill is owned by Luigi Rossi of New York, the Sisters go to see the Bishop in a nearby city. He is unable to help them financially with their project however, but does give them a small amount of money to tide them over. When they return to Bethlehem, Bob's manservant, Anthony James offers them a ride from the railroad station in Bob's jeep. As Sister Margaret learned to drive a jeep during the war, they arrange to borrow the jeep to go to New York City to find Mr. Rossi and ask him to donate his land. Rossi runs a \"bookie\" operation and, with perseverance, the Sisters manage to see him. After he tells them that he intends to build his retirement home on the site, they prepare to leave, then learn that Rossi's son was killed in action near their hospital in Rouen. Suddenly, Rossi changes his mind and tells them that, if they will install a stained glass window in the hospital in memory of his son, the land is theirs. Later, in Bethlehem, Bob and his girl friend, Kitty Blaine, are listening to a recording of a new song he has composed when the Sisters come to thank him for the use of the jeep. Bob then announces that he will be going to Hollywood for a few weeks to work on a picture. Later, the Sisters acquire for $5,000, a three-month option on a former witch hazel bottling plant opposite the Rossi property, for use as a temporary shelter. However, when the Bishop looks over the papers, he discovers that the purchase price carries a $25,000 mortgage and tells the Sisters he will have to cancel the contract. At that moment, however, eleven more nuns and a chaplain arrive from France, and the Bishop relents, allowing them to stay for the period of the option with the understanding that if they cannot raise the additional money within that time, they must all leave. When Bob returns from Hollywood with Kitty and three house guests, he discovers that the nuns are having a produce-and-arts sale in Miss Potts's yard and Bob insists that she evict all the nuns. On the day before the option is to lapse, the nuns find themselves $500 short of the necessary amount. That evening, after Kitty performs Bob's new song for his guests, they hear the nuns singing a hymn which they recognize as being similar to Bob's song. Concerned about being accused of plagiarism, Bob swears that he first thought of the melody after his Army outfit landed in France four years earlier. Guest Al Newman, a music critic, identifies it as an ancient Gregorian chant. The next morning, after Sisters Margaret and Scolastica accidentally drive a stake through Bob's water line, he visits the real estate agent and arranges to buy the plant in order to keep it out of the nuns's hands. Sister Margaret, meanwhile, discovers Bob's guests playing tennis and arranges a $500 wager if Sister Scolastica can help Al beat the other couple.

"Name": "Come to the Stable",
"Storyline": "One winter's night, two French nuns, Sisters Margaret and Scolastica, come to the small New England town of Bethlehem, where they meet Amelia Potts, a painter of religious pictures. After the Sisters announce that they have come to build a hospital there, Chicago-born Sister Margaret explains that during the war she was in charge of a children's hospital in Normandy when it became a potential target during a military campaign. As many of the children could not be evacuated, Sister Margaret made a personal plea to an American general not to shell the hospital which, the Germans were using as an observation post. The hospital was spared but at the cost of American lives, and Sister Margaret made a promise to God that, in gratitude for saving the children, she would return to America to build a children's hospital there. When Miss Potts is puzzled as to why they chose Bethlehem, Sister Margaret replies that they had received a postcard with a reproduction of a nativity scene painted by Miss Potts, entitled \"Come to the Stable,\" and information about the Bethlehem area. The Sisters then decide that a local hill depicted in another of Miss Pott's paintings would be a good site for the hospital. After composer Bob Mason, who is Miss Potts's neighbor, tells the Sisters that the hill is owned by Luigi Rossi of New York, the Sisters go to see the Bishop in a nearby city. He is unable to help them financially with their project however, but does give them a small amount of money to tide them over. When they return to Bethlehem, Bob's manservant, Anthony James offers them a ride from the railroad station in Bob's jeep. As Sister Margaret learned to drive a jeep during the war, they arrange to borrow the jeep to go to New York City to find Mr. Rossi and ask him to donate his land. Rossi runs a \"bookie\" operation and, with perseverance, the Sisters manage to see him. After he tells them that he intends to build his retirement home on the site, they prepare to leave, then learn that Rossi's son was killed in action near their hospital in Rouen. Suddenly, Rossi changes his mind and tells them that, if they will install a stained glass window in the hospital in memory of his son, the land is theirs. Later, in Bethlehem, Bob and his girl friend, Kitty Blaine, are listening to a recording of a new song he has composed when the Sisters come to thank him for the use of the jeep. Bob then announces that he will be going to Hollywood for a few weeks to work on a picture. Later, the Sisters acquire for $5,000, a three-month option on a former witch hazel bottling plant opposite the Rossi property, for use as a temporary shelter. However, when the Bishop looks over the papers, he discovers that the purchase price carries a $25,000 mortgage and tells the Sisters he will have to cancel the contract. At that moment, however, eleven more nuns and a chaplain arrive from France, and the Bishop relents, allowing them to stay for the period of the option with the understanding that if they cannot raise the additional money within that time, they must all leave. When Bob returns from Hollywood with Kitty and three house guests, he discovers that the nuns are having a produce-and-arts sale in Miss Potts's yard and Bob insists that she evict all the nuns. On the day before the option is to lapse, the nuns find themselves $500 short of the necessary amount. That evening, after Kitty performs Bob's new song for his guests, they hear the nuns singing a hymn which they recognize as being similar to Bob's song. Concerned about being accused of plagiarism, Bob swears that he first thought of the melody after his Army outfit landed in France four years earlier. Guest Al Newman, a music critic, identifies it as an ancient Gregorian chant. The next morning, after Sisters Margaret and Scolastica accidentally drive a stake through Bob's water line, he visits the real estate agent and arranges to buy the plant in order to keep it out of the nuns's hands. Sister Margaret, meanwhile, discovers Bob's guests playing tennis and arranges a $500 wager if Sister Scolastica can help Al beat the other couple. Although Sister Scolastica is a former tennis champion, she loses the match. Later, after Sister Margaret tells the Sisters that they must leave, Bob eavesdrops on their prayers and discovers that their Mother House is in Normandy, near where he was stationed. When the Sisters ask him to pray for them, Bob is moved to change his mind about their project, and soon he, Kitty, Miss Potts, Mr. Rossi and the Bishop attend the dedication of the temporary home of the hospital of St. Jude.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "At the Beverly Hills Hotel, after a long night of drinking, sports writer Mike Hagen is hung over and anxious because he cannot recall writing his <I>      New York Record      </I> assignment that was due the previous evening. When fashion designer Marilla, whom Mike does not recognize, informs him that they actually wrote the story together and then attempts to return the $700 Mike paid her for her help, Mike, charmed by the spunky woman, insists that they spend the money together vacationing in California. After a whirlwind courtship, the couple marries and returns to New York, where Mike abandons his small, cluttered apartment for Marilla's East Side abode, site unseen. While packing Mike's apartment, Marilla finds a picture of woman caught in a seductive pose, but disregards it to avoid any conflict. At the newspaper office, editor Ned Hammerstein warns Mike that crooked boxing promoter Martin J. Daylor has placed several calls threatening Mike's life because of the reporter's articles about Daylor's racket. Later, Mike lunches with his previous girl friend, actress Lori Shannon, and announces his recent marriage. Lori soon grows angry at Mike's effusive descriptions of Marilla and tips a plate of ravioli in his lap. As Lori storms out of the restaurant, Marilla arrives and suspects the accident was caused by something other than his carelessness. After changing into a pair of short busboy pants, Mike returns with Marilla to her upscale apartment, where they walk into a surprise wedding shower thrown by Marilla's friends. Mike is embarrassed by his attire and contemptuous of the ceremonious gentility of the actors, artists and designers who surround Marilla while ignoring him. The only guest to befriend Mike is Broadway producer Zachary Wilde, whom Mike shuns when he realizes Zachary is Marilla's ex-boyfriend. Later, Marilla apologizes for her friends's behavior and tearfully defends her job to a stunned Mike. For several weeks the couple are quite happy while managing to keep their professional worlds apart. Then one night, Marilla attends a boxing match with Mike, where she is overwhelmed by the brutal fight, Daylor's threats and informant Charlie Arneg's demands for more money for information. The following week, Mike and his cronies gather at the apartment for their weekly poker game while, in another room, Marilla holds a reading of Zachary's musical, for which she has been chosen to design the costumes. The evening turns into a fiasco when dimwitted ex-boxer Maxie Stulz scares Marilla with his violent boxing stories and choreographer Randy Owen accidentally upturns the poker table with his wild dance steps. After everyone leaves, Mike mocks Randy for his effeminate behavior, but the dancer suddenly returns and offers to fight Mike over the incident. Marilla jokes that Randy is as punchy as Maxie, thus relieving the conflict. Days later, Mike attends Marilla's <I>     haut couture     </I> fashion show and finds Lori, the musical's new star, at his wife's table. Both he and Lori act as if they have never met, but when Mike bolts from his chair thinking Lori is about to dump her food again, Marilla becomes suspicious. During a subsequent rehearsal, Marilla finally concludes that Mike and Lori have had an affair when she recognizes Lori as the woman in the seductive picture. Meanwhile, at Marilla's apartment, Johnny O and several other Daylor henchmen try to force Mike to stop writing the articles by punching him. When Marilla walks in, Mike makes an excuse for his bloody lip and introduces the henchmen as his friends. After they leave, Marilla admits to previous romantic relationships hoping Mike will acknowledge his relationship with Lori, but Mike does not confess. When Marilla accuses him of lying, Mike denies the affair and leaves abruptly. At the office, Ned suggests Mike hide out to evade the gangsters while finishing his exposé on Daylor's boxing racket. He assigns Maxie to protect Mike, ordering the boxer to punch anyone who looks \"cross-eyed\" at Mike. After telling Marilla that he is leaving town to follow the Yankees, Mike checks into a seedy hotel with Maxie. On the couple's first night apart, Mike contends with the over-protective Maxie, who sleeps with his eyes open, while Marilla fantasizes that Mike is continuing his affair with Lori. The next day, Marilla begs Zachary to interrogate Lori, but Zachary asks the actress to dinner instead and later assures Marilla of Lori's innocence. Over the next few weeks, Mike calls Marilla from the hotel, claiming to be in various cities, while he continues to write about Daylor. Meanwhile, at Daylor's hangout, the racket boss has deduced that Mike is hiding in New York and sends his henchmen to find him. One night, when Marilla calls Mike and threatens to confront Lori herself, Mike tells her to do so. Mike then tricks Maxie into falling asleep, slips out of the hotel and rushes to Lori's apartment. He has concocted a story about how he and Lori briefly met, thus explaining the picture, but Lori assures him that Marilla will not believe the lie. Suddenly, Marilla arrives at the apartment, forcing Lori to hide Mike in her bedroom. As Marilla enters the apartment, Lori's poodle jumps into her arms, disarming her, but when the dog later comes out of the bedroom carrying Mike's shoe, Marilla follows the dog back to Mike. Outraged by his betrayal, Marilla runs from the building. Meanwhile, Maxie wakes up and, finding Mike gone, loudly calls his name out in the lobby, where Charlie overhears him. Upon locating Mike, Charlie, who has discovered that Daylor plans to kidnap Marilla during the opening night of the musical in Boston, offers to sell him the information. After Charlie tells him about Marilla's danger, Mike places a call to the Boston stage to warn her, but she ignores his pleas. While Maxie and Mike catch the next plane to Boston, Lori, whose costume Marilla is aggressively altering with her scissors, finally admits to the affair with Mike. She suggests to Marilla that she accept Mike's story because he is only trying not to hurt her. Marilla leaves the dressing room satisfied that her husband meant no harm and longs to reunite him. When Johnny O suddenly appears, Marilla, still assuming he is one of Mike's friends, accepts his offer to take her to Mike immediately. Mike and Maxie arrive just as Johnny and several other henchmen are forcing Marilla into their car. When a fistfight ensues, Mike yells \"cross-eyed,\" inciting Maxie to punch everyone, including Zachary and the stagehands who are trying to help. Randy then leaps into action, knocking out all the henchmen with his acrobatic footwork and thus establishing his masculinity. When Mike finally tells Marilla the lie about his relationship with Lori, she lovingly accepts it as a token of his true devotion. Months later, Zachary and Lori are happily engaged while Maxie continues to insist he is making a comeback. With Daylor behind bars and his underworld business destroyed, Mike and Marilla enjoy their marriage and each other's differences. <BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "As soon as Hollywood press agent Bill Dunnigan returns the body of his dear friend, actress Olga Treskovna, to her home in Coaltown, Pennsylvania, he is barraged with money demands from local funeral director Nick Orloff.  While driving with Orloff to the funeral parlor, Bill remembers his first meeting with the young Polish beauty: Olga is about to be fired from the chorus line of a burlesque show when Bill, a theater publicist who has been observing the rehearsal, convinces the show's choreographer to give her another chance.  Although Bill is deeply attracted to Olga, he leaves without seeing her perform.  Back in Coaltown, Bill tries to locate friends of Olga's dead, alcoholic father to act as pallbearers for her funeral, but, as the greedy Orloff had predicted, the only men who accept the job demand two dollars for their efforts.  Disgusted, Bill begins to reminisce about his reunion with the kindhearted Olga: On a snowy Christmas Eve, while waiting for a train in a small town, Bill discovers that Olga is acting in a cheap touring show.  Bill and Olga are delighted to see each other after a year's separation and dine together at a Chinese restaurant.  There, the sagacious owner, Ming Gow, treats the couple to a feast and suggests that their reunion was predestined. Afterward, Olga, who is plagued by a hacking cough, points out the star that her father \"gave\" her as a child and offers Bill half of it.  Bill is touched by the gift, but says goodbye to Olga once more and returns to the East. Coming out of his reverie, Bill goes to see Father Paul, the priest at Coaltown's impoverished St. Michael's church, where Olga had asked to be buried.  Bill is impressed by Father Paul's generous, warm nature, and after arranging for Olga's funeral, he tells the priest about Olga's days in Hollywood: As a press agent for movie producer Marcus Harris, Bill once again runs into Olga after the tempermental star of Harris' latest epic, <I> Joan of Arc </I>, is fired.  Olga has been working as the star's stand-in and when she sees Bill on the set, she invites him to dinner in her one-room apartment.  During the evening, Bill gets the idea to cast Olga as \"Joan\" and has her perform a scene from the movie for him.  Impressed, Bill then convinces Harris to test her for the role, and she easily wins the part.  Olga soon becomes the talk of Hollywood, but while she is filming <I> Joan of Arc </I>, her cough grows worse.  Concerned about her health, Bill goes to see her doctor and learns that, as a result of being exposed to coal dust as a child, she has developed tuberculosis and will die without immediate treatment. Despite Bill's warnings, Olga insists on finishing the last, dramatic scene of the picture.  Her performance is inspired, but when she dies a day after filming is completed, Harris decides to shelve the project rather than release the film with a dead, unknown star.  After relating this story to Father Paul, Bill is suddenly inspired with an idea for a publicity stunt.  Writing a series of bad checks, Bill pays every church in Coaltown to ring their bells for three days and nights in honor of Olga's passing. He then wires Harris and, assuring him that he has found a way to release <I> Joan of Arc </I>, asks him to send $10,000. After the bells begin to ring, reporters appear in Coaltown, and to convince them of his sincerity, Bill relates Olga's dying moments: On her deathbed, Olga tells Bill that she was driven to become a movie star as a way of fulfilling the lost dreams of the poor people of Coaltown. Sure that her appearance in <I> Joan of Arc </I> will bring hope to her hometown, Olga declares her \"job\" done and dies. The reporters are moved by Bill's words and print Olga's story in newspapers across the country.  Despite the instant publicity, the skeptical Harris still refuses to release <I> Joan of Arc </I>, fearing that Olga's notoriety will be short-lived.  At the same time, the owner of the biggest mine in Coaltown is threatening to silence the bells, and Father J. Spinsky, of the well-to-do St. Leo's church, is threatening to arrest Bill for writing bad checks unless he agrees to hold Olga's funeral in his parish.  Although Harris wires Bill enough money to cover his debts, he insists on re-shooting <I> Joan of Arc </I> with another star. Thus defeated, Bill wanders into St. Michael's church, which is packed with worshippers anxious to see the now-famous Olga.  Suddenly, two large religious statues begin to turn on the altar until they are facing Olga's casket. Bill rushes to see Father Paul, who has already deduced that the statues moved because the weight of the crowd caused the pillars on which the statues were mounted to shift slightly. Although Father Paul is reluctant to describe the movement as a miracle, Bill convinces him to tell the people of Coaltown that divine intervention played some part in the event.  The statues' turning is picked up by the press, and after listening to a radio report about its effect on Coaltown, Harris flies to the town and announces that he is releasing <I> Joan of Arc </I>.  He also offers to build a hospital in Olga's name, which would be dedicated to finding a cure for the lung disease that killed the star.  As Bill says a final farewell to his beloved Olga, reborn worshippers flood the streets of Coaltown.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Inspired by Reverend Daniels' Sunday sermon on charity and goodness, compulsive do-gooder Sam R. Clayton offers his neighbors, the Butlers, the use of his car for their one-day vacation after their own car breaks down.  Sam's kindness annoys his good-natured wife Lu, who protests the gesture with a string of sarcastic barbs.  Lu also protests the continuing presence of her deadbeat brother Claude, an ex-serviceman who, at Sam's insistence, has been sponging off of them for six months.  That night, the Butlers call to inform Lu that they are keeping the car for an extra day, and the next morning, Sam is forced to pay mechanic Mr. Nelson for fixing the Butlers' car.  Much to Lu's frustration, Sam also invites the chatty Nelson to breakfast and cajoles her into agreeing to prepare goose grease for Nelson's asthmatic wife.  Later at the department store where Sam is the general manager, his boss, H. C. Borden, scolds him for spending too much time conversing with the customers and not pushing the Christmas merchandise. Dismissing Borden's complaints, Sam then comforts Shirley Mae, a young music department clerk, who is seriously depressed because her married lover has dumped her and left her homeless.  That night, Nelson and his wife show up at Sam's house and all but invite themselves to dinner.  During the meal, Mrs. Nelson, who is a real estate agent, mentions that a wonderful house may go on the market, exciting Lu about the possibility of finally buying her own home. Sam is then called to see the Adamses, a young couple to whom he loaned money when Mrs. Adams discovered she was pregnant and was considering an abortion. The Adamses tell Sam that, even though the gas station they bought with his money is now a success, they can repay him only in small installments because they have invested in a house for themselves and their soon-to-arrive baby. Although understanding, Sam feels frustrated about the money and announces to Lu, who knows nothing about the Adamses' loan, that he is finally \"through with people.\" He then begins to denounce the Butlers, unaware that the family is in his living room, having told Lu that the nearsighted Mr. Butler was in an accident in Sam's car and is being sued by the other party. In addition, because the car is registered to Sam, and Mr. Butler has lost his job, Sam will be forced to pay for all the damages.  After Sam throws the Butlers out, Lu suggests that they also throw Claude out and is thrilled when her brother calls to announce that he is leaving to play pool in Cincinnati. Before the couple can enjoy their first night alone together in six months, however, their daughter Lulu interrupts, demanding a bedtime story.  Just as Sam and Lu get Lulu to sleep, Claude returns, having changed his mind about Cincinnati, and Shirley Mae, who has taken an overdose of pills, is dropped off by a cab driver who found Sam's address in her pocket.  At her wit's end, Lu later confers with Reverend Daniels and confesses that her marriage is in trouble because of Sam's incorrigible goodness.  Daniels promises to talk discreetly to Sam, but the next day, a bemused Sam reports to Lu that the reverend's marriage is faltering.  Lu's spirits are finally lifted when she takes a tour of her dream house and believes that their $5,000 \"nest egg\" can be used as a down payment. When Sam reveals that he loaned the Adamses their house savings, Lu breaks down in tears. Then, in the midst of their ensuing argument, Reverend Daniels arrives to discuss a charity bazaar for which Sam has volunteered Lu's services.  Although Lu participates in the bazaar, she tells Sam afterward that Borden has offered her a job buying for the store in Europe.  As Sam and Lu argue about the offer, they overhear Claude romancing Shirley Mae on the porch, causing Lu to call the clerk an immoral gold digger.  A crushed Shirley Mae leaves the house, and to Sam's surprise, the Adamses then show up with a check for $6,000, having sold their gas station for a huge profit.  After Sam tells Lu that he will never change, Lu begins to feel contrite, especially after she learns that Claude, who has taken a job at the Adamses' new gas station, has proposed to Shirley Mae.  Sam, meanwhile, is put in charge of the store's Christmas charity dinner and is robbed of all his money after he has already paid for the turkeys with part of the house savings.  Sam tries to secure a bank loan, but is turned down because of his unstable credit history.  Unable to face Lu, who has already moved into the new house and is preparing a celebratory dinner, Sam seeks refuge in a bar.  While his family waits nervously for his return, the bank officer who rejected Sam announces to Lu that he has changed his mind about the loan.  Just as Lu is about to panic, a very drunken Sam is escorted home by a Salvation Army band, and Sam learns that not only will he receive the loan, but has been made vice-president of the store.  A relieved Lu then lovingly embraces her inebriated husband.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Although Lu participates in the bazaar, she tells Sam afterward that Borden has offered her a job buying for the store in Europe.  As Sam and Lu argue about the offer, they overhear Claude romancing Shirley Mae on the porch, causing Lu to call the clerk an immoral gold digger.  A crushed Shirley Mae leaves the house, and to Sam's surprise, the Adamses then show up with a check for $6,000, having sold their gas station for a huge profit.  After Sam tells Lu that he will never change, Lu begins to feel contrite, especially after she learns that Claude, who has taken a job at the Adamses' new gas station, has proposed to Shirley Mae.  Sam, meanwhile, is put in charge of the store's Christmas charity dinner and is robbed of all his money after he has already paid for the turkeys with part of the house savings.  Sam tries to secure a bank loan, but is turned down because of his unstable credit history.  Unable to face Lu, who has already moved into the new house and is preparing a celebratory dinner, Sam seeks refuge in a bar.  While his family waits nervously for his return, the bank officer who rejected Sam announces to Lu that he has changed his mind about the loan.  Just as Lu is about to panic, a very drunken Sam is escorted home by a Salvation Army band, and Sam learns that not only will he receive the loan, but has been made vice-president of the store.  A relieved Lu then lovingly embraces her inebriated husband.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

That night, Mytyl is complaining to her parents when word comes that war has been declared and her father has been summoned to protect the frontiers.  The children then go to bed, where Mytyl dreams of the Fairy Berylume, who sends her and Tyltyl off to find the blue bird of happiness. Tylette, the treacherous family cat, and Tylo, the loyal family dog, go along to keep them company and Light shines in to to show them the way.  They begin their search in the past, where the children come to the graveyard in which their Grandpa and Grandma slumber.

Soon discovering that happiness lies not in riches, the children begin to long for their parents, and with the help of Tylo, escape from the land of Luxury. Tylette then ventures into the forest where, hoping to thwart the children's quest, she admonishes the trees to terrify them into returning home.  The trees conspire with wind and fire to kill the children, and in the ensuing storm, Tylette perishes while the children escape to visit the Kingdom of the Future to search for the blue bird.  In the future, they meet the unborn children of the world waiting for Father Time to take them to Earth in his ship of silver sails. Finally returning home, Mytyl awakens to learn that a truce has been declared and finds the blue bird in her very own home.  Filled with joy, Mytyl presents the bird to Angela, who experiences a miraculous recovery.  As Angela fondles the bird, it  flies away to freedom, but Mytyl assures her they will always be able to find it again.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

The two groups are immediately at odds because of a near collision on the snowy road leading to the lodge. The lodge sports director Ralph P.

"Name": "Come to the Stable",
"Storyline": "One winter's night, two French nuns, Sisters Margaret and Scolastica, come to the small New England town of Bethlehem, where they meet Amelia Potts, a painter of religious pictures. After the Sisters announce that they have come to build a hospital there, Chicago-born Sister Margaret explains that during the war she was in charge of a children's hospital in Normandy when it became a potential target during a military campaign. As many of the children could not be evacuated, Sister Margaret made a personal plea to an American general not to shell the hospital which, the Germans were using as an observation post. The hospital was spared but at the cost of American lives, and Sister Margaret made a promise to God that, in gratitude for saving the children, she would return to America to build a children's hospital there. When Miss Potts is puzzled as to why they chose Bethlehem, Sister Margaret replies that they had received a postcard with a reproduction of a nativity scene painted by Miss Potts, entitled \"Come to the Stable,\" and information about the Bethlehem area. The Sisters then decide that a local hill depicted in another of Miss Pott's paintings would be a good site for the hospital. After composer Bob Mason, who is Miss Potts's neighbor, tells the Sisters that the hill is owned by Luigi Rossi of New York, the Sisters go to see the Bishop in a nearby city. He is unable to help them financially with their project however, but does give them a small amount of money to tide them over. When they return to Bethlehem, Bob's manservant, Anthony James offers them a ride from the railroad station in Bob's jeep. As Sister Margaret learned to drive a jeep during the war, they arrange to borrow the jeep to go to New York City to find Mr. Rossi and ask him to donate his land. Rossi runs a \"bookie\" operation and, with perseverance, the Sisters manage to see him. After he tells them that he intends to build his retirement home on the site, they prepare to leave, then learn that Rossi's son was killed in action near their hospital in Rouen. Suddenly, Rossi changes his mind and tells them that, if they will install a stained glass window in the hospital in memory of his son, the land is theirs. Later, in Bethlehem, Bob and his girl friend, Kitty Blaine, are listening to a recording of a new song he has composed when the Sisters come to thank him for the use of the jeep. Bob then announces that he will be going to Hollywood for a few weeks to work on a picture. Later, the Sisters acquire for $5,000, a three-month option on a former witch hazel bottling plant opposite the Rossi property, for use as a temporary shelter. However, when the Bishop looks over the papers, he discovers that the purchase price carries a $25,000 mortgage and tells the Sisters he will have to cancel the contract. At that moment, however, eleven more nuns and a chaplain arrive from France, and the Bishop relents, allowing them to stay for the period of the option with the understanding that if they cannot raise the additional money within that time, they must all leave. When Bob returns from Hollywood with Kitty and three house guests, he discovers that the nuns are having a produce-and-arts sale in Miss Potts's yard and Bob insists that she evict all the nuns. On the day before the option is to lapse, the nuns find themselves $500 short of the necessary amount. That evening, after Kitty performs Bob's new song for his guests, they hear the nuns singing a hymn which they recognize as being similar to Bob's song. Concerned about being accused of plagiarism, Bob swears that he first thought of the melody after his Army outfit landed in France four years earlier. Guest Al Newman, a music critic, identifies it as an ancient Gregorian chant. The next morning, after Sisters Margaret and Scolastica accidentally drive a stake through Bob's water line, he visits the real estate agent and arranges to buy the plant in order to keep it out of the nuns's hands. Sister Margaret, meanwhile, discovers Bob's guests playing tennis and arranges a $500 wager if Sister Scolastica can help Al beat the other couple. Although Sister Scolastica is a former tennis champion, she loses the match. Later, after Sister Margaret tells the Sisters that they must leave, Bob eavesdrops on their prayers and discovers that their Mother House is in Normandy, near where he was stationed. When the Sisters ask him to pray for them, Bob is moved to change his mind about their project, and soon he, Kitty, Miss Potts, Mr. Rossi and the Bishop attend the dedication of the temporary home of the hospital of St. Jude.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Come to the Stable",
"Storyline": "One winter's night, two French nuns, Sisters Margaret and Scolastica, come to the small New England town of Bethlehem, where they meet Amelia Potts, a painter of religious pictures. After the Sisters announce that they have come to build a hospital there, Chicago-born Sister Margaret explains that during the war she was in charge of a children's hospital in Normandy when it became a potential target during a military campaign. As many of the children could not be evacuated, Sister Margaret made a personal plea to an American general not to shell the hospital which, the Germans were using as an observation post. The hospital was spared but at the cost of American lives, and Sister Margaret made a promise to God that, in gratitude for saving the children, she would return to America to build a children's hospital there. When Miss Potts is puzzled as to why they chose Bethlehem, Sister Margaret replies that they had received a postcard with a reproduction of a nativity scene painted by Miss Potts, entitled \"Come to the Stable,\" and information about the Bethlehem area. The Sisters then decide that a local hill depicted in another of Miss Pott's paintings would be a good site for the hospital. After composer Bob Mason, who is Miss Potts's neighbor, tells the Sisters that the hill is owned by Luigi Rossi of New York, the Sisters go to see the Bishop in a nearby city. He is unable to help them financially with their project however, but does give them a small amount of money to tide them over. When they return to Bethlehem, Bob's manservant, Anthony James offers them a ride from the railroad station in Bob's jeep. As Sister Margaret learned to drive a jeep during the war, they arrange to borrow the jeep to go to New York City to find Mr. Rossi and ask him to donate his land. Rossi runs a \"bookie\" operation and, with perseverance, the Sisters manage to see him. After he tells them that he intends to build his retirement home on the site, they prepare to leave, then learn that Rossi's son was killed in action near their hospital in Rouen.

Henry's affair with Stella, a married woman, is ruined by the constant appearance of the two girls, who Stella is convinced are teenaged detectives hired by her suspicious husband. Marian's divorced mother is devoted to her child, but Valerie comes from an unhappy home dominated by her self-centered and adulterous mother, Isabel.

Valerie learns of the illicit affair and, shattered, returns home only to be told by her mother that she must never see Marian again. Mr. Boyd, however, decides to leave Isabel and start a new life with Valerie. After a trip to Europe, Valerie visits the Gilbert apartment and resumes her friendship with Marian.

"Storyline": "In 1183, King Henry II of England summons his estranged wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom he has imprisoned for 10 years in Salisbury Tower for her part in civil wars and plots against him. Henry has called a Christmas Court at Chinon Castle to determine which of their three surviving sons--the impetuous Richard, the conniving Geoffrey, or the clumsy and insecure John--will be named successor to the crown. Also present are Henry's mistress, Princess Alais, who has been promised as wife to the new heir, and her 18-year-old brother, Philip, the king of France. Henry chooses John as successor, but Eleanor, fully aware that Henry holds all three sons in low esteem, proclaims that the throne rightfully belongs to Richard. Almost immediately, the protagonists plot to attain their own selfish ends: Eleanor offers to yield Aquitaine if Richard is named heir; Geoffrey, neglected by both parents, conspires with John and Philip to rob Richard of the throne; and Henry confesses to Alais that he intends to get his way without giving her up. It is decided that an alliance with the king of France might solve all their problems, and Eleanor sends Richard to convince Philip of the merit of their cause. The youthful king is equal to the machinations of his elders, however; confronting Henry, he exposes the homosexual bent of Richard, the treachery of Geoffrey, and the disloyalty of John. Outraged, Henry disowns his sons and demands from Eleanor an annulment of their marriage, declaring that he will marry Alais and father a new heir, but Alais insists that Henry execute his sons to protect any child she might bear. Intent on murder, Henry descends into the dungeon where his sons are imprisoned, but Eleanor has preceded him and armed the three princes to aid their escape. Although Henry raises his sword over Richard's head, he cannot bring himself to wield it. Once the others have left and Eleanor and Henry are alone, the two adversaries face the incontestable truth that the bond between them is too strong to be broken by any struggle for power. The next morning, with nothing resolved, Henry escorts Eleanor to the barge that will return her to prison; she leaves, hopeful that there will soon be a summons to appear at Chinon for an Easter Court.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

Attracted to Queenie, the Dude decides to help her turn the club into a popular speakeasy, and two years later she has paid off all of her father's debts. Everything is going right for the Dude, who thinks that his luck comes from his daily purchase of an apple from \"Apple Annie,\" a disheveled old apple vendor who leads the Broadway panhandlers.  He is about to make a deal with Chicago gangster Steve Darcey, and Queenie has agreed to marry him.  Just as the Dude is about to close his deal with Darcey, however, his boys are unable to find Annie. Panicky that he won't have the luck he needs for pulling off the Darcey deal, the Dude learns where Annie is from a group of panhandlers who visit his apartment.  They tell him that Annie has been supporting a daughter who has been living in a Spanish convent for years and that all of the extra money she has squeezed from them has gone to the girl.  In an elaborate deception, Annie has been sending and receiving letters from the girl, named Louise, at the swank Marberry Hotel.  When the hotel employee who had been Annie's contact was fired for apparently \"stealing\" one of the letters, Annie went boldly in and retreived it herself, only to discover that it announced Louise's imminent marriage and arrival in New York with her fianceé and his father, a Spanish count.  When the Dude visits Annie, accompanied by Queenie, who has decided to leave the Dude and marry someone else if he closes the Darcey deal, she drunkenly confirms what has happened.  Although he is sympathetic, he leaves with his apple, but after the panhandlers offer their meagre savings to finance a real stay for Annie at the Marberry and Queenie goads him into rethinking the matter, the Dude agrees to help.  Using a rich friend's appartment at the Marberry, and with the aid of the kindly butler Hutching, the Dude installs Annie as a tenant.  With Queenie's help, and that of several hairdressers, makeup artisits and clothiers, Annie is transformed into her elegant society alter ego, Mrs. E Worthington Manville.  To complete the picture, Judge Henry Blake, a silver-throated pool hustler, is brought in to play her husband.  When the boat arrives that night, the transformed Annie greets Louise, her fiancé Carlos and his father, Count Romero.  Reporters on the dock are suspicious when they see the Dude and his gang there and try to get a story, but the Dude's boys Junior and Joy Boy arrange to have the reporters taken away.  For the next several days, while the boys try to keep Darcey occupied, Annie and Louise's reunion proceeds joyfully, while the Dude gets swept up in the fairy tale. Despite Joy Boy's constant nagging that Darcey will tire of waiting for a final meeting and turn violent, the Dude cools his heals. Meanwhile, newspaper stories about the missing reporters have surfaced, and the entire city is up-in-arms.  From the beat cops to the chief of police, the mayor and even the governor, everyone is being criticized in the press for inaction.  As the day of Louise and the Romero's departure approaches, the marriage seems a certainty until Count Romero insists on meeting some of Mrs. Worthington's society freinds. Realizing that the marriage will not go through without some kind of reception, the Dude and Judge Blake tutor his gang on gentlemanly repartee and manners, while Queenie teaches her chours girl freinds how to hehave like \"ladies.\"  After intensive coaching, the group seems ready for their debut as society substitutes at the planned reception, but just as they are about to leave Queenie's club, some panhandlers let the Dude know that the police, suspicious that the Dude is involved in the reporters' kidnapping, have surrounded them.  As Annie waits in despair and the Count becomes increasingly suspicious because no one has come to the reception, the Dude is questioned by the police commisioner.  Unable to explain the situation to the commissioner's satisfaction, the Dude then admits that he has the reporters and promises to kill them unless he is taken to the mayor.  While the Dude is being taken to the mayor, who also is having a reception that night, Annie decides that she has no choice but to tell the count the truth.  Just as she is about to reveal everything, however, the Dude arrives, accompanied by the mayor, the governor and all of the society guests from the mayor's New Year's Eve reception.  As each person greets Annie, they pretend to know her well, which greatly impresses the count.  After the reception, limousines drive everyone to the dock to see Louise and the Romeros off.  With the reporters safe and no real crimes committed, state and city officials, as well as newspaper editors, decide that no one need ever know the truth.  As Annie lovingly waves goodbye to Louise, the Dude tells Queenie that he is going to move to Maryland with her and forget about Darcey, and after the boat pulls away, Annie orders her panhandling friends to get back to work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "On Christmas Eve in New York City, Gillian Holroyd, the owner of a gallery specializing in native primitive art, laments that her life is devoid of romance.  Gil's interest is piqued by her new upstairs neighbor, publisher Sheperd Henderson.  When Shep returns home from work that evening, he finds a garrulous woman snooping around his apartment who introduces herself as Queenie Holroyd, his neighbor.  After Shep brusquely ushers Queenie, who unknown to him is a witch, out of his apartment, she glares at his phone and casts a spell on it.  Upon discovering that his phone is out of order, Shep goes downstairs and asks to use Gil's phone.  As he dials a number, Queenie, who is Gil's aunt, walks into the gallery and urges her to steal Shep away from his fiancée.  Gil, who is also a witch, realizes that Queenie has rendered Gil's phone inoperable and chastises her for inappropriately using her magical powers.  Before Shep leaves to meet his fiancée, Queenie mentions that she and Gil are going to the Zodiac Club that night.  Later at the club, as Gil's bongo-playing, warlock brother Nicky beats his drums, Gil tells Queenie that she longs to forswear her witchery and become \"ordinary.\"  Soon after, Shep enters with his snobbish fiancée, Merle Kittridge.  When Gil recognizes the condescending Merle as the woman with whom she went to college and who reported her to the dean for not wearing shoes, she decides to exact revenge on her.  Recalling that Merle is terrified of thunder, Gil simulates a thunderstorm by using her powers to direct Nicky and the other musicians to blare their instruments into Merle's ear, sending her screaming from the club.  At Gil's gallery later that night, the Holroyds exchange Christmas gifts and Nicky gives Gil a magic potion to summon whomever she desires.  Recalling that Shep expressed interest in best-selling author Sidney Redlitch, Gil uses the potion to bring Redlitch to New York.  When Shep returns home from his date with Merle, he sees flames dancing from a bowl in which Gil has activated the potion.  Alarmed by the fire, Shep raps on Gil's door.  Aware of Gil's feelings for Shep, Nicky and Queenie immediately excuse themselves, after which Gil offers him a drink.  As Shep prattles on about marrying Merle the next day, Gil picks up her magic cat Pyewacket, through whom she channels her spells, and casts a spell on Shep.  After a magical night, Shep finds himself in love with Gil and declares that he feels \"spellbound.\"  That morning, Shep informs an indignant Merle that he wants to \"uncouple.\"  When Shep goes to his office, he finds Redlitch sitting in the waiting room, wondering why he has experienced an inexplicable urge to travel to New York and discuss his new book with Shep.  After Redlitch, an authority on magic, proposes writing an exposé about witches in New York, Shep is skeptical.  Redlitch then brags that he can recognize a witch by the fact that they are unable to blush or cry.  When Redlitch mentions that witches hang out at the Zodiac Club, a shocked Shep invites Redlitch to have a drink with him and Gil at the Zodiac that night.  There, after Redlitch outlines his new book idea to Gil, Gil tells Nicky to derail the project.  Instead, as Nicky walks home with Redlitch, he offers to collaborate on the book for fifty percent of the profits.  When Nicky  states that, as a warlock, he is in a unique position to help Redlitch, the author is skeptical until Nicky casts a spell that makes the street light flash on and off.  In the following days, as Shep and Gil pursue romance, Nicky discloses the secrets of his trade to Redlitch.  When Shep proposes to Gil one night, she demurs because, according to the precepts of witchcraft, falling in love will bring an end to her magical powers.  Gil soon reconsiders, however, and accepts Shep's proposal.  After Gil informs Nicky that she plans to renounce witchcraft and marry Shep, he is incredulous.  Fearful that Shep will discover she was a witch, Gil then asks Nicky to stop helping Redlitch, and when he refuses, warns him that she is going to conjure up one last spell to sabotage the book.  True to her word, Gil hexes Redlitch's manuscript, causing Shep to throw it in the garbage as worthless.  Feeling guilty about using her powers to ensnare Shep, Gil confesses to him that she is a witch and Nicky a warlock, but he thinks she is joking.  As Shep is ruminating over the possibility of Gil being a witch, he runs into Queenie, who confirms that Gil put a spell on him to spite Merle.  Shep then confronts Gil, demanding to know if she ever loved him.  After storming out of the gallery, Shep goes to the Zodiac to talk to Nicky and Redlitch.  They drive him to the home of Mrs. Bianca De Pass, a prominent sorceress, who mixes a potion to break Gil's spell. After reluctantly downing the potion, Shep returns to his apartment to pack up his belongings.  Stopping at the gallery, Shep hands Gil a broom and says goodbye. When Gil spitefully threatens to put a spell on Merle, Shep hurries to her apartment to warn her, but she thinks he has lost his mind.  As Gil prepares to cast her spell, she discovers that Pyewacket is missing.  When Queenie returns Pyewacket to Gil, the feline runs away from her, and as Gil begins to cry, she realizes that she has lost her powers by falling in love.  As the months pass, Gil becomes more and more despondent.  Concerned about her niece's welfare, Queenie decides to reconcile Gil and Shep.  One day, Pyewacket unexpectedly jumps through Shep's office window.  When Shep brings the cat back to Gil at her gallery, he finds that the gruesome primitive masks have been replaced by delicate, colorful shells.  Upon seeing Shep, Gil becomes flustered, blushes and cries.  Realizing that she has lost her magic powers and therefore must be in love with him, Shep embraces her.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "The week before Christmas, New York business tycoon James C. Pidgeon is facing bankruptcy due to the extravagant spending of his wife Clara. At his office, J. C. is pestered by his jovial, good-for-nothing brother-in-law, Willie Crawford, but is cheered by a telegram from his son Reggie, who informs him that J. C.'s rich uncle is on his deathbed. Believing that his financial problems will soon be solved, J. C. accompanies Willie home, where Clara is supervising preparations for Christmas.  Also at home is Therese, the Pidgeon's snobbish elder daughter, who is determined to make her unconventional family presentable for her socially prominent fiancé, Stephen Bates.  Therese insists that the family take in a \"charity case\" for the holidays in order to impress Stephen.  Reluctantly giving into Therese's whims, her parents bring home a charity case advertised in the newspaper as \"Mr. M.\" The mystery man turns out to be Anthony Marchaund, a once-renowned actor who became a drunkard and handyman after being injured in an auto accident ten years earlier.  Admonished by a newspaper official to be grateful, Marchaund charms the family with his polite, refined manners, although one afternoon he drinks too much and is hidden by the butler, MacFarland, until he recovers. While Marchaund is resting unseen on the couch, the family discovers that their eccentric uncle has died and left his five-million-dollar fortune to an actress whose performance as \"Little Eva\" in <I> Uncle Tom's Cabin </I> impressed him thirty years previously.  Knowing only that the actress' last name is Watson and that she may live in New York, the uncle ordered that if she was not found, the inheritance would revert to J. C.  Desperate for the money, J. C. persuades the estate's lawyer to conduct only a week-long search for the actress.  Marchaund then makes his presence known and suggests contacting the Actors Equity Assocation for help.  Fearing that Marchaund will try to blackmail them, the family promises to \"take care\" of him if he helps them, and he easily locates the actress, Florie Watson.  Willie and Marchaund visit Florie, who is so broke that she accepts Willie's contrived story that she is their long-lost cousin with whom they wish to spend Christmas.  Therese is furious that the family has complicated her Christmas plans with Stephen, but Angela, the younger daughter, is charmed by Florie's open, good-hearted nature. J. C. has no intention of telling Florie about her inheritance, and in order to keep her away from the increasing amount of publicity about the unusual will, the Pidgeons take her to one of J. C.'s rental properties in the country.  Stating that it belonged to a deceased aunt, the Pidgeons take Stephen, Florie and Marchaund to the cabin, although the unhospitable conditions prompt the servants to quit.  Florie takes charge of the cooking and housekeeping, and soon even Clara and Angela are enjoying their chores.  Florie, who has fallen in love with Marchaund, urges him to quit drinking and return to the stage, but Marchaund demurs, insisting that he is a has-been.  Two detectives, seeking to notify Florie about her inheritance, trace her to the cabin, but the Pidgeons and Marchaund dissuade them from searching the property. Later, as the family glumly sits around the fireplace on Christmas Eve, Marchaund's uneasy conscience prompts him to try to help Florie.  Hoping to inspire the family to tell the truth, the drunken actor terrifies them with a stirring rendition of <I> A Christmas Carol </I>, then collapses.  The Pidgeons, who have grown fond of Florie, are ashamed of their greed, and tell her about her inheritance. Florie is stunned, but forgives her friends for their deception, and the reformed Pidgeons enjoy the rest of the evening.  The next morning, Florie tries to thank Marchaund, but instead finds a note in which he confesses his feelings for her, but contends that he must leave.  Florie goes to the nearest bar and there finds Marchaund.  She tells him that she is splitting the inheritance with the Pidgeons, and the happy couple laugh as they realize that they do not have enough cash to pay for their drinks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "The week before Christmas, New York business tycoon James C. Pidgeon is facing bankruptcy due to the extravagant spending of his wife Clara. At his office, J. C. is pestered by his jovial, good-for-nothing brother-in-law, Willie Crawford, but is cheered by a telegram from his son Reggie, who informs him that J. C.'s rich uncle is on his deathbed. Believing that his financial problems will soon be solved, J. C. accompanies Willie home, where Clara is supervising preparations for Christmas.  Also at home is Therese, the Pidgeon's snobbish elder daughter, who is determined to make her unconventional family presentable for her socially prominent fiancé, Stephen Bates.  Therese insists that the family take in a \"charity case\" for the holidays in order to impress Stephen.  Reluctantly giving into Therese's whims, her parents bring home a charity case advertised in the newspaper as \"Mr. M.\" The mystery man turns out to be Anthony Marchaund, a once-renowned actor who became a drunkard and handyman after being injured in an auto accident ten years earlier.  Admonished by a newspaper official to be grateful, Marchaund charms the family with his polite, refined manners, although one afternoon he drinks too much and is hidden by the butler, MacFarland, until he recovers. While Marchaund is resting unseen on the couch, the family discovers that their eccentric uncle has died and left his five-million-dollar fortune to an actress whose performance as \"Little Eva\" in <I> Uncle Tom's Cabin </I> impressed him thirty years previously.

"TitleId": "68818",
"Name": "The Bishop's Wife",
"Storyline": "During the Christmas season, Dudley, an angel in the guise of a mortal, strolls around a small town and notices Julia Brougham, the bishop's wife, gazing wistfully through a store window.  Dudley follows Julia to a Christmas tree lot, where she meets her old friend, Professor Wutheridge, and expresses her sadness that her husband Henry is too busy worrying about fund raising for a new cathedral to enjoy the season with his parishioners.  The professor offers Julia a contribution of an ancient Roman coin from his collection.  After Julia leaves for home, Dudley purposely bumps into the professor and makes inquiries about the Broughams.  When Julia arrives home, she finds Henry in a tense meeting with several important parishioners, including Mrs. Agnes Hamilton, a wealthy widow, who insists that her large contribution toward the cathedral's construction guarantee a proper memorial to her dead husband.  Henry is upset by Julia's tardiness and the meeting breaks up after Mrs. Hamilton threatens to withdraw her support unless satisfied. Julia mentions seeing the professor and gives Henry the ancient coin, which he angrily dismisses as worthless.  Trying to make amends for his curtness, Henry asks Julia to have lunch with him the following day as they used to do, and she delightedly agrees.  After retiring to his study, however, Henry is beset by messages and demands on his time.  Dismissing his assistant, Mildred Cassaway, Henry prays for guidance, and a few moments later, Dudley mysteriously arrives and informs Henry that he is an angel sent in answer to his prayer.  Henry is immediately skeptical, and when Julia comes in a few moments later, Dudley introduces himself as Henry's assistant, which pleases her and upsets Henry. The next morning Henry is dismayed to see that Dudley has returned and ingratiated himself with Mildred Cassaway, the maid, Matilda, and even the family dog, Queenie.  Julia is disappointed that Henry has broken their luncheon date and sadly takes their young daughter Debby to the park.  After Henry departs, Dudley follows Julia and Debby to the park and helps the little girl build her confidence during a snowball fight.  Dudley offers to take Julia to lunch just as Matilda inexplicably shows up to relieve her of Debby. Dudley takes Julia to Michel's, which she reveals is her favorite restaurant and is where Henry proposed to her. When they are spotted by several parish ladies, Dudley wards off gossip by inviting them to join him and Julia. Walking home later, Julia and Dudley run into the professor, who is suspicious of Dudley, yet invites them to his tiny apartment, where he admits that due to a lack of inspiration he has not worked for some time on his manuscript about ancient Rome.  Dudley, who has retrieved the ancient coin from the Brougahms', returns it to the professor and piques his interest by informing him of the rare and valuable coin's unique history.  Meanwhile, Henry has rescheduled his appointments so that he can make his lunch date with Julia and is annoyed to discover that she has gone out with Dudley.  The next day, Dudley tells Debby the story of David, who is helped by an angel, which only vexes Henry further. Later, Henry accepts an appointment to meet with Mrs. Hamilton, knowing it will conflict with his promised appearance at choir practice at his old parish. Despite Julia's pleas, Henry insists on seeing Mrs. Hamilton, and Dudley accompanies Julia to the rehearsal.  At Mrs. Hamilton's, Henry agrees to all her demands in exchange for her complete support of the cathedral but, while hastening to leave to meet Julia, finds himself stuck to a recently varnished chair.  At the church, meanwhile, Rev. Miller is embarrassed by the poor turnout, but Dudley reassures him and asks the couple of boys present to begin singing. Gradually all the boys arrive and give an inspiring performance under Dudley's direction.  As the still-stuck Henry fumes at Mrs. Hamilton's, Dudley and Julia catch a cab into town where Dudley purchases a hat for Julia he knows she admires.  Then Dudley asks the cab driver, Sylvester, to stop at a park where a crowd is ice skating and, with Dudley's guidance, both Julia and Sylvester skate enthusiastically.  Dudley and Julia return home, where Henry angrily demands that Dudley leave for good.  Henry's outburst depresses Julia, and the next day, Christmas Eve, the household wonders if Dudley will ever return.  After Henry and Julia leave to make calls, Dudley arrives and rewrites Henry's Christmas sermon, dictating while the typewriter takes down the new speech.  Dudley then transforms the Christmas tree over which Matilda has been laboring and departs to see Mrs. Hamilton.  While waiting in the wealthy woman's drawing room, Dudley discovers a hidden piece of sheet music inscribed to Mrs. Hamilton from a man who is not her husband.  Dudley plays the tune on Mrs. Hamilton's harp, and she confesses that in her youth she was in love with the tune's composer, but feared poverty and rejected him.  In an effort to make up for not loving her wealthy husband, she has steadfastly tried to maintain his legacy. Later, when Henry and Julia arrive, Mrs. Hamilton thanks Henry for sending Dudley to her and tells them that he has inspired her to give her money to the needy rather than build the cathedral.  Utterly dismayed, Henry tells Julia he will meet her at home and, wandering into town, stops by the professor's, where he confides that Dudley is an angel who has upset everything. He apologizes for rejecting the professor's coin, which the old scholar returns to him, declaring that it has inspired him and may help Henry too.  When Henry sadly reveals he believes he has lost Julia to Dudley, the professor reminds him that he is human and Dudley is not and encourages him to fight for Julia.  At the Broughams' home, while Dudley and Julia stand admiring the Christmas tree, Dudley tells her it is time for him to leave, but asks her to have him stay. Disturbed by his implication, Julia tells him that he must go and hastens upstairs just as Henry arrives to challenge Dudley. Dudley is pleased that Henry has finally acknowledged that Julia is the most important thing in his life and reminds the bishop that he never prayed for a cathedral, but for guidance.  He wistfully adds that it is bad when an angel envies a mortal and informs Henry that after he goes, no one will have any memory of his existence.  Henry then finds himself alone in his study praying before the painting of the cathedral, and abruptly races upstairs looking for Julia, who is putting Debby to bed.  They embrace and then depart for St. Timothy's where Henry delivers Dudley's Christmas sermon.  Dudley listens from the street, and satisfied, departs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Babes in Toyland",
"Storyline": "In the village of Toyland, evil old Silas Barnaby threatens to evict the Widow Peep, who lives in a shoe, unless she allows him to marry her daughter Bo-Peep.  The widow refuses his demand, much to the relief of Bo-Peep, who is in love with handsome Tom-Tom Piper.  Desperate for money to pay off her mortgage, Widow Peep asks for help from her well-meaning but simple lodgers, Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, who assure her that they can borrow the money from their employer, the Toymaker.  After they arrive at work, however, their hopes for a loan are dashed when it is discovered that they made a mistake in an order for Santa Claus.  Instead of the 600 one-foot tall toy soldiers that Santa needs, the boys told the toymakers to build 100 six-foot tall soldiers. The enraged Toymaker fires them and they return home just as Barnaby is again threatening Bo-Peep and her mother.  Unable to pay Barnaby, the boys resolve to obtain the deed to the shoe, and so, that night, Ollie hides in a box that Stannie takes to Barnaby as a Christmas present.  The boys intend to steal the deed while Barnaby sleeps, but he discovers their ruse, and the next day, Old King Cole proclaims that the would-be thieves are to be ducked in the pond and permanently banished to Bogeyland.  Ollie's dignity is dampened by the ducking, but he and Stannie are saved from banishment by Bo-Peep, who agrees to marry Barnaby if he drops the charges and allows her mother to move back into the shoe.  Soon after, Bo-Peep and her mother are sadly waiting with Stannie and Ollie for the wedding ceremony to begin. As Ollie laments having to give Bo-Peep away, Widow Peep goes to Barnaby's house to plead for mercy, which he refuses to give. Ollie then arrives with the bride, who is demurely covered with a heavy veil, and the wedding commences.  After the ceremony, Barnaby gives the deed to Ollie, who tears it up, but when Barnaby lifts the veil to kiss his bride, he finds Stannie, not Bo-Peep.  Barnaby vows revenge, and later that night, kidnaps Elmer, one of the Three Little Pigs, and plants evidence to make Tom-Tom appear guilty.  The next day, during Tom-Tom's trial, Stannie and Ollie find Elmer in Barnaby's cellar, but by the time they bring him back, Tom-Tom has already been sent to Bogeyland. Bo-Peep rushes off to find her sweetheart, while the townspeople chase Barnaby, who goes to Bogeyland through a secret passageway in his well.  Stannie and Ollie follow him and find Bo-Peep and Tom-Tom, then are chased back to Toyland by Barnaby and the monstrous bogeymen whom he controls.  Back at Toyland, everyone welcomes the returned heroes, but chaos breaks out as the village is overrun by Barnaby's mauraders. A resourceful mouse takes to the air in a toy blimp and drops miniature torpedoes on the bogeymen, while Stannie and Ollie start up the giant wooden soldiers. The soldiers march out of the toy factory and soon rout the bogeymen. Stannie and Ollie attempt to shoot a parting volley of darts at the fleeing monsters, but the cannon tips over and covers Ollie's backside with darts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "Sabrina",
"Storyline": "One evening, during an annual party at Oliver Larrabee's Long Island estate, chauffeur's daughter Sabrina Fairchild sits in a tree, spying lovingly on David,  Oliver's ne'er-do-well son.  After observing the thrice-divorced David and a giggling debutante dancing and flirting in the indoor tennis court, Sabrina runs, crying, to the rooms she shares with her widowed English father Thomas.  Thomas gently scolds Sabrina for \"reaching for the moon\" and reminds her that, the next day, she is going to cooking school in Paris, far away from David.  Later, in her bedroom, Sabrina ponders her situation, then writes her father a suicide note, shuts herself in the garage and starts the engines of all eight cars.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nAs Sabrina begins to succumb to the fumes, Linus Larrabee, David's middle-aged, conservative brother, hears the rumbling of the engines and opens the garage to investigate.  Unaware of her intentions, Linus saves Sabrina and carries her back to her room.  Sometime later, in Paris, Sabrina, still lovesick over David, stumbles through her cooking classes.  Deducing the cause of Sabrina's distracted behavior, an elderly baron who is enrolled in the school takes charge of her, transforming her into a sophisticated woman.  On Long Island, meanwhile, David, who continues to aggravate Linus with his irresponsible attitudes toward the family business, storms into Linus' New York office, angry over a newspaper item announcing his engagement to socialite Elizabeth Tyson.  Linus admits that he planted the item, as he wants David to marry Elizabeth, because her father owns sugar factories in Puerto Rico, and Larrabee Industries needs sugar to manufacture a new type of plastic.  After Linus convinces David that the financial merger hinges on the marital \"merger,\" David, who has been dating Elizabeth, agrees to the engagement.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nLater, Sabrina, having completed her two-year cooking course, returns to America.  With a new hairdo, sleek Paris clothes and fluffy dog named David, Sabrina waits for her father at the Long Island train depot and is pleasantly surprised when David drives up and offers her a ride.  Not recognizing Sabrina, David flirts with her and drives her all the way home before realizing who she is.  Though stunned, David asks her out that night, then remembers that his family is hosting a party to which Elizabeth has been invited.  Sabrina, who is aware of David's engagement, insists on attending, confidently telling her father later that the moon is now \"reaching for her.\"  At the party, David slips away from an unsuspecting Elizabeth to dance with Sabrina, who is dressed in a dazzling Paris gown.  David instructs Sabrina to wait for him in the tennis court, but before he can leave with his bottle of champagne and glasses, he is waylaid by Linus and Oliver.  After the eccentric Oliver lectures David about dallying with the servants, Linus forces David, who has the champagne glasses tucked in his back pockets, to sit down.  David's rear end is impaled with broken glass, and while he writhes in pain, Linus meets Sabrina at the tennis court.  When Sabrina admits that she is in love with David, Linus claims to endorse the romance and dances with her.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe next day, after presenting David with a plastic hammock with a hole cut out for his rear end, Linus announces he is taking Sabrina sailing.  David thanks Linus for \"taking care of\" Sabrina and remains oblivious to his scheming, even after Elizabeth shows up to nurse him.  While pondering whether to go sailing in his Yale University beanie and sweater, Linus informs his father that he is wooing Sabrina in order to distract her from David and thereby protect the merger.  On the boat, Linus talks about his two long-lost loves, claiming that he almost committed suicide over one, and Sabrina suggests that he go to Paris to forget his troubles.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe next day, while driving Linus to town, Thomas overhears Linus making arrangements for a date with Sabrina and asks him to be \"gentle\" with his daughter.  Linus assures the class-conscious Thomas that he is sending Sabrina back to Paris, first-class, but when Sabrina arrives at his office, Linus tells her that he is sailing to Paris.  At dinner, Sabrina speaks glowingly about Paris and advises Linus not to bring his umbrella, as it will make him look like a tourist.  On the drive home, Sabrina sings the romantic French song \"La vie en rose,\" and Linus hints that he is falling in love with her.  Later, Sabrina, her feelings about the brothers now confused, tells David that she does not want to see Linus anymore, but the almost recuperated David insists that she be nice to Linus, their only \"ally.\"  The next day, at Linus' office, Elizabeth goes over her wedding plans with Linus, and Linus presents Mr. Tyson with his merger contract.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nAfterward, Linus explains to Oliver that he is going to buy two boat tickets to Paris and will trick Sabrina into thinking he is on board until she is safely away from New York.  Linus also reveals he is paying Sabrina's living expenses in Paris, as well as giving her father some Larrabee stock.  Later, Sabrina, who has a dinner date with Linus, telephones him from the office lobby and tells him she cannot see him.  Linus persuades Sabrina to come up to his office and asks her to cook an omelette.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThoroughly confused, Sabrina starts to cry until she notices two boat tickets to Paris on Linus' desk and deduces that one is meant for her.  Chagrined by Sabrina's joy, Linus confesses his deception, and heartbroken, Sabrina takes her ticket and leaves.  The next morning, before a board meeting, David confronts Linus in his office, slugging him after revealing that Sabrina broke off with him.  David then declares he is going to Paris, even though he knows that Linus is in love with Sabrina.  During the board meeting, Linus announces that the merger is off as David is on his way to Paris with Sabrina, but before Elizabeth, her father and the board can register their shock, David storms in and goads Linus into hitting him and admitting that he loves Sabrina.  After David tells him that a tugboat is waiting to take him to Sabrina's ocean liner, Linus races to the docks.  Once on board the liner, Linus discards his umbrella and reunites with a surprised Sabrina.<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The African Queen",
"Storyline": "In September 1914 in the German East African village of Kungdu, British Reverend Samuel Sayer and his spinster sister Rose lead prayers at the makeshift First Methodist Church. The natives struggle to follow the English psalm, but race outside when they hear Canadian Charlie Allnut's ancient launch the <I>   African Queen </I> chug into the village, laden with mail and goods. Though conscious of his lower social standing, Charlie lunches with the Sayers, who delicately ignore his rumbling stomach. Before leaving, he informs them about the encroaching war in Europe, and although the Sayers are frightened, they refuse to desert the village. Only hours later, however, German troops invade Kungdu, imprison the natives and burn down the huts. By the time the smoke clears, Samuel has begun to lose his mind from shock and grief. He soon collapses, unintentionally wounding Rose by raving that their attraction to missionary work grew out of a lack of more attractive social options. When Charlie returns to the destroyed village the next day, he finds Samuel dead, and helps Rose bury him. She then accepts Charlie's offer to hide from the Germans on his boat. Once they are on the river, Charlie explains that the Germans have positioned a heavily armed steamer, the <I>  Louisa  </I>, at the mouth of Lake Tanganyika to block British troops. Rose immediately forms a plan to attack the <I>  Louisa  </I> by crafting torpedoes out of explosives and an oxygen tank, strapping them to the <I>  African Queen  </I> and ramming into the steamer. Charlie tries desperately to dissuade her, describing the German fort and impassable rapids they will have to face along the way, but Rose's determination eventually shames him into agreeing to the plan. After they set sail, he teaches Rose how to read the river, and they negotiate how to bathe in private. That night, a pouring rain forces Charlie to seek shelter under Rose's tarpaulin, and after at first banishing him, Rose softens and allows him to sleep near her. They reach the first set of rapids the next afternoon, and Charlie's hopes that the death-defying experience will frighten Rose are dashed after she proclaims it the most stimulating physical experience she has ever had. At night, a frustrated Charlie taps into his gin reserves and later rants drunkenly that he will not sail any farther, calling Rose a \"skinny old maid.\" He awakes the next morning to find her pouring each of his gin bottles into the ocean. Hours later, he begs her to speak to him, and she finally reveals that it is his refusal to sail which has infuriated her. Charlie yells but then quickly backs down, agreeing to accompany her while doubting their chances for success. Their first obstacle is the German fort, where the soldiers open fire on the <I>  African Queen  </I>. The engine is hit, but Charlie repairs it and they sail on. Immediately afterward, they reach another set of rapids. Rose struggles to steer while Charlie races to keep the engine stoked, and although they are badly pummeled, they miraculously reach calm waters. Thrilled, Charlie and Rose fall into an embrace which quickly becomes romantic. Later, as they declare their love, they finally learn each other's first name. They then sail peacefully past exotic flora and fauna until they hit a waterfall, which damages the rudder. Although Charlie despairs, Rose devises a plan to weld a new rudder, and days later, the boat is fixed. Just miles down the river, however, they are attacked by a horde of mosquitoes, which terrifies Rose and forces them to stay in open water. Within days, they become lost in the stagnant shallows. Thick reeds bog down the boat, forcing Charlie to pull it through the water. When he finally boards again, exhausted, he finds leeches covering his body, and even though he is shaking with revulsion, he must return to the water to keep the boat moving. Hours later, they reach land, where Charlie feverishly tells Rose they may not make it but that he loves her. They both collapse into sleep, and during the night, a fresh rain sweeps the launch downstream onto Lake Tanganyika. They awaken to find the <I>  Louisa  </I> only miles away, and retreat into the reeds to hide. By the next day, they have discerned the ship's sailing pattern and Charlie makes the torpedoes. They set out on their attack that night, but a sudden storm capsizes the launch and Rose and Charlie are separated in the dark. Charlie is imprisoned by the Germans and, not wanting to live without Rose, accepts his sentence of hanging. Just then, however, Rose is brought in, and when she hears that Charlie is to be killed, proudly admits their whole scheme to the soldiers. Before they are hanged, Charlie requests that the captain marry them, and just as the service ends, the <I>  African Queen  </I> surfaces, hits the <I>  Louisa  </I> and explodes. Floating together in the water, the newlyweds see the boat's nameplate, realize that their plan has succeeded after all, and happily swim toward the shore.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "The African Queen",
"Storyline": "In September 1914 in the German East African village of Kungdu, British Reverend Samuel Sayer and his spinster sister Rose lead prayers at the makeshift First Methodist Church. The natives struggle to follow the English psalm, but race outside when they hear Canadian Charlie Allnut's ancient launch the <I>   African Queen </I> chug into the village, laden with mail and goods. Though conscious of his lower social standing, Charlie lunches with the Sayers, who delicately ignore his rumbling stomach. Before leaving, he informs them about the encroaching war in Europe, and although the Sayers are frightened, they refuse to desert the village. Only hours later, however, German troops invade Kungdu, imprison the natives and burn down the huts. By the time the smoke clears, Samuel has begun to lose his mind from shock and grief. He soon collapses, unintentionally wounding Rose by raving that their attraction to missionary work grew out of a lack of more attractive social options. When Charlie returns to the destroyed village the next day, he finds Samuel dead, and helps Rose bury him. She then accepts Charlie's offer to hide from the Germans on his boat. Once they are on the river, Charlie explains that the Germans have positioned a heavily armed steamer, the <I>  Louisa  </I>, at the mouth of Lake Tanganyika to block British troops. Rose immediately forms a plan to attack the <I>  Louisa  </I> by crafting torpedoes out of explosives and an oxygen tank, strapping them to the <I>  African Queen  </I> and ramming into the steamer. Charlie tries desperately to dissuade her, describing the German fort and impassable rapids they will have to face along the way, but Rose's determination eventually shames him into agreeing to the plan. After they set sail, he teaches Rose how to read the river, and they negotiate how to bathe in private. That night, a pouring rain forces Charlie to seek shelter under Rose's tarpaulin, and after at first banishing him, Rose softens and allows him to sleep near her. They reach the first set of rapids the next afternoon, and Charlie's hopes that the death-defying experience will frighten Rose are dashed after she proclaims it the most stimulating physical experience she has ever had. At night, a frustrated Charlie taps into his gin reserves and later rants drunkenly that he will not sail any farther, calling Rose a \"skinny old maid.\" He awakes the next morning to find her pouring each of his gin bottles into the ocean. Hours later, he begs her to speak to him, and she finally reveals that it is his refusal to sail which has infuriated her. Charlie yells but then quickly backs down, agreeing to accompany her while doubting their chances for success. Their first obstacle is the German fort, where the soldiers open fire on the <I>  African Queen  </I>. The engine is hit, but Charlie repairs it and they sail on. Immediately afterward, they reach another set of rapids. Rose struggles to steer while Charlie races to keep the engine stoked, and although they are badly pummeled, they miraculously reach calm waters. Thrilled, Charlie and Rose fall into an embrace which quickly becomes romantic. Later, as they declare their love, they finally learn each other's first name. They then sail peacefully past exotic flora and fauna until they hit a waterfall, which damages the rudder. Although Charlie despairs, Rose devises a plan to weld a new rudder, and days later, the boat is fixed. Just miles down the river, however, they are attacked by a horde of mosquitoes, which terrifies Rose and forces them to stay in open water. Within days, they become lost in the stagnant shallows. Thick reeds bog down the boat, forcing Charlie to pull it through the water. When he finally boards again, exhausted, he finds leeches covering his body, and even though he is shaking with revulsion, he must return to the water to keep the boat moving. Hours later, they reach land, where Charlie feverishly tells Rose they may not make it but that he loves her. They both collapse into sleep, and during the night, a fresh rain sweeps the launch downstream onto Lake Tanganyika. They awaken to find the <I>  Louisa  </I> only miles away, and retreat into the reeds to hide. By the next day, they have discerned the ship's sailing pattern and Charlie makes the torpedoes. They set out on their attack that night, but a sudden storm capsizes the launch and Rose and Charlie are separated in the dark. Charlie is imprisoned by the Germans and, not wanting to live without Rose, accepts his sentence of hanging. Just then, however, Rose is brought in, and when she hears that Charlie is to be killed, proudly admits their whole scheme to the soldiers. Before they are hanged, Charlie requests that the captain marry them, and just as the service ends, the <I>  African Queen  </I> surfaces, hits the <I>  Louisa  </I> and explodes. Floating together in the water, the newlyweds see the boat's nameplate, realize that their plan has succeeded after all, and happily swim toward the shore.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Upon returning to New York from a December holiday in Lake Placid, Johnny Case drops by to see his dear friends, Nick and Susan Potter, and gleefully informs them that he has become engaged to a beautiful woman he met at the resort.  When Susan questions Johnny about his bride-to-be, Julia Seton, Johnny confesses that he knows nothing about her background or family life.  Later, when he shows up at Julia's Park Avenue address, he is stunned to discover that she is the daughter of Edward Seton, an extremely wealthy banker. While Julia goes to church to break the news of her engagement to her conservative widower father, Johnny spends time with Linda, Julia's unconventional, outspoken sister, and Ned, her alcoholic but charming brother. As he and Linda chat in the playroom, the only \"human\" room in the Seton mansion, Johnny proudly tells Linda about his dreams and aspirations.  The thirty-year-old Johnny reveals that because he has worked hard ever since he was a child, he now feels that he should take a long-term holiday and discover the true meaning of life. In turn, Linda confesses that because of their father's domination over the years, both she and Ned have been unable to find their place in the world.  Mr. Seton, meanwhile, is stunned by Julia's announcement and immediately questions her about Johnny's financial standing and background.  However, after meeting Johnny and drilling his employer about his competency, Mr. Seton agrees to the marriage.  Although Linda, who adores her sister, suggests that they hold a small, informal engagement party, Julia willingly bows to her father's desire to have an enormous New Year's Eve party. Deeply disappointed, Linda refuses to come down for the lavish affair and holes up in the playroom.  The Potters arrive and, while wandering around the mansion, accidentally end up in the playroom with Linda.  Embarrassed by Linda's obvious absence from the festivities, Julia sends Johnny to fetch her, and Johnny is delighted to be reunited with his wisecracking friends.  At the same time, Julia's snobbish cousins, Seton and Laura Cram, track Linda to the playroom and interrupt the group's fun.  Just as Linda and Johnny, who loves to do backflips, are about to demonstrate a tumbling trick they have just perfected, Julia and Mr. Seton burst into the room and insist that Linda join the party.  Mr. Seton then offers Johnny a job at his bank, forcing Johnny to reveal his \"early retirement\" plans.  Both Julia and her father are upset by Johnny's pronouncements, and a despondent Johnny sees the New Year in with Linda.  Later, Linda tearfully confesses to Ned that she has fallen in love with Johnny but intends to hide her feelings. Immediately after the engagement is announced, Johnny leaves the celebration without saying goodbye.  Days later, Linda, anxious to reunite the lovers, visits the Potters and learns that Johnny is planning to sail with them to Europe that night and has asked Julia to join him.  When a telegram from Johnny arrives announcing that Julia has turned him down, Linda rushes back home to admonish Julia.  After the sisters argue about the situation, Mr. Seton joins the discussion and decries Johnny as \"un-American.\"  Julia smugly predicts that Johnny will return to her, and moments later, a contrite Johnny shows up and tells Mr. Seton that he is willing to work at his bank on condition that he can quit after two years if he is unhappy there.  When Mr. Seton begins to plan the honeymoon in detail, however, Johnny balks and, after revealing that he loves his freedom more than he loves Julia, leaves for the dock.  Linda then senses that Julia is actually relieved by Johnny's departure and forces her to admit that she no longer loves him.  Inspired by Johnny's defiance, Linda declares her own independence and rushes from the house.  At dockside, the Potters are overjoyed when Johnny boards the ship without Julia, and Johnny is delighted when Linda takes her sister's place by his side.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "It's a Big Country: An American Anthology",
"Storyline": "On a transcontinental train, a talkative traveler takes the seat next to a professor reading a book.  The talkative man interrupts the professor with his continual boasting about how wonderful America is, until the professor asks, \"Which America?\"  To the other man's befuddlement, the professor explains there are many kinds of America and that they are all changing. He mentions the political and historical America, the country as part of the world community, and the American personality, which includes immigrants and the American Indians.  This quiets the talkative man, and in the dining room, when an elderly woman says she is proud to be a part of America, he asks, \"Lady, which America?\"<BR>\r\n        In Boston, Mrs. Brian O'Riordan, an elderly Irish American living in a modest house dwarfed among skyscrapers, is disturbed after reading in the newspaper that the 1950 census has been completed, and she realizes that she has not been counted. She takes a bus to see the managing editor of the newspaper, Mr. Callaghan, and complains that she is seventy-four, and that the next census will not be for another ten years. Callaghan takes her name and address, then sends reporter Michael Fisher to pose as a census official and get a human interest story from her, but Mrs. O'Riordan recognizes Fisher from the newsroom and reprimands him. Callaghan now sincerely tries to help, calling a number of census bureau officials, but they refuse to offer assistance.  Indignant, he calls connections at Congress and the White House, and drives with Fisher to Mrs. O'Riordon's home with flowers to apologize. A man from the census bureau then arrives, saying his office received a call from Washington. The census taker becomes impatient when Mrs. O'Riordan is long-winded in answering the questions, but Callaghan, enjoying the bureaucrat's discomfort, advises her to answer in her own way, as they have all afternoon.<BR>\r\n       African-American military and civilian leaders are shown and lauded; persons shown include Brigadier General Benjamin O'Davis; his son, Lt. Col. Benjamin Davis; Jackie Robinson; Jesse Owens; Joe Louis; Sugar Ray Robinson; Levi Jackson; Lena Horne; the Perry Brothers; Marian Anderson; Ethel Waters; Duke Ellington; Louis Armstrong; Eddie Anderson; Justice Francis Rivers of the City Court of New York; Judge Jane Bowland of the New York Court of Domestic Relations; noted radiologist Dr. Benjamin W. Anthony; Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.; the Right Reverend Bravid Harris; Irvin Molleson, appointed to the Federal Bench; Pauly Murray, former deputy attorney general of California; architect Paul Williams; the 1946 mother of the year, Mrs. Irma Clement; Dr. Ralph Bunche; and the late George W. Carver.  A statue of Booker T. Washington is shown.<BR>\r\n       Hungarian-American Stefan Szabo raises a family of six daughters while running a company that produces \"Szabo's Best U.S. Hungarian Paprika.\"  On the first day of summer, he complains that he will have no peace until his daughters marry. They respond that only that week he turned down proposals from five suitors for Rosa, the eldest, as he was unhappy with the \"Smiths, Cohens and O'Rileys\" who pursue her.  He reserves his greatest dislike for Greeks, because, he says, Hungarians have hated Greeks for 500 years. As Rosa walks to the bus to go to business college, Icarus Xenophon pulls up his car alongside her, and they fall in love at first sight. He offers her a job and drives her to school, and she tells him that her father is afraid she will fall in love before she marries, which Hungarian girls are not allowed to do. Icarus confesses that he has never been in love before, and by the time they reach school, he proposes. When he shows her his confectionary store, he reveals he is Greek, and she says she cannot marry him because Hungarians, especially her father, hate Greeks. He convinces her, however, to stay and work for him.  As she works, they stare at each other, then realize they cannot stand it any longer.  When Rosa tells her father the name of her employer, he gets worried, but she quickly says that he has a pretty wife who works in the store.  Sam, the youngest daughter, decides to investigate, and at the store, she sees Rosa and Icarus kissing.  She tells Papa, and they collect all the family members to descend on the ice cream parlor. Papa accuses Icarus of being untrue to his wife, and Icarus protests his innocence.  When patrons of the nearby Graeco-American Athletic Club arrive, they admire Rosa's sisters.  Rosa then enters with groceries and shows her father her wedding ring.  Everyone congratulates them, and Rosa tells her father, who sits forlornly at the counter, to get used to it.  Icarus relates that when his father was upset, he used to make coffee.  Papa vows never to drink Greek coffee, but when he is shown that the coffee offered is \"Washington Post Coffee,\" he drinks it and embraces Rosa and Icarus.<BR>\r\n       It is stated that the fighting men of the United States are composed of all heritages and creeds.  Following his term of duty in the Korean War, Maxie Klein rings the bell of Mrs. Wrenley and introduces himself as a buddy of her deceased son Jack.  She is visibly upset when he mentions his Jewish name and says she does not recall Jack ever mentioning a \"Maxie,\" but when she mentions he always wrote about \"Jo-Jo,\" he says that is what Jack called him. He reads Mrs. Wrenley Jack's last letter, in which Jack writes that freedom, democracy and tolerance are not mere words, but are the real reason he is fighting. Mrs. Wrenley cries, as Jack, in the letter, calls Maxie \"my kind of people\" and his best pal. As Maxie prepares to go, Mrs. Wrenley says she would be glad to rent Jack's room to him, if he was not returning home, and that she'd like to write his mother about what a fine boy she has.  Maxie kisses her, then leaves.<BR>\r\n       A Texan rolls a cigarette and talks about the \"America of wide open spaces,\" and the \"funny ideas\" and exaggerations that people have about Texas.  With tongue in cheek, he downplays the state's size, the ease of finding oil there, its large ranches, hospitality and pretty girls, and its independence from the rest of the country.  He warns with a wink that people should not listen to the rumors about his state.<BR>\r\n       In 1944, Adam Burch, a new minister, is ordained to serve at St. Thomas Church in Washington, D.C., where the President of the United States attends when his schedule permits.  Rev. Burch, somewhat overwhelmed at the prospect of preaching before the president, decides to prepare a sermon on \"spiritual manifestations of our society as reflected in the war effort.\" The president does not show up, however, and Burch preaches to yawning parishioners. After five weeks of similarly high-minded sermons, Burch asks the sexton his opinion of the sermon he is preparing, and the sexton tells him he is not doing a good job.  He points out that Burch has been preaching to one man, rather than to the whole congregation.  In the reverend's next sermon, he admits he was in error and that he has learned that he must function as a minister for the entire congregation.  Afterwards, a secret service man comes to his office to say that the president came into the church just as he began his sermon and listened from the back. The metallic sound of crutches is heard when the president, as just one of the flock, comes to the door.<BR>\r\n       In an elementary school in San Francisco, the teacher, Mrs. Coleman, calls on Joseph Esposito to do a division problem on the board, and when the boy says that the numbers are too small, she suggests he needs glasses.  At home, Joey's father, a proud Italian-American immigrant, argues with his wife when Joey brings home a letter suggesting he should go to the optometrist, then goes to see the teacher himself.  He complains that glasses will make Joey different from his friends, but she contends that his schoolwork is suffering. Papa refuses to allow the glasses, but when Joey gets a headache from reading, his mother takes him to the optometrist.  While playing with friends, Joey sees his father coming.  He takes off his new glasses just as he is about to jump for a ladder and missing it, falls into a pile of bricks. As Joey recovers from his injury, Miss Coleman tutors him, and when she arrives for supper one night, Papa puts on glasses himself. Everyone looks surprised, then Joey puts his own on, and Papa tells him they look good. A narrator relates that ours is a big, wonderful country, proud of its past, strong in its present and confident in its future. It is one nation: the land of the free and home of the brave.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "At Louie Dumbrowski's sweet shop in New York's Bowery district, friends Terence Aloysius \"Slip\" Mahoney, Horace DeBussy \"Sach\" Jones and Butch Williams pay for their banana splits with yet another worthless check. Louie berates the boys for their lack of ambition and says they should be more like their other pal, Chuck Anderson, who works as a copy boy at the <I>     Blade     </I> newspaper. Just then, Chuck rushes in with news that he has been promoted to reporter and assigned to a big story, although he does not elaborate. Later, another <I>     Blade     </I> reporter named Sy Bowman comes to the shop and informs the friends that Chuck was badly beaten in a riot at the state penitentiary, where he was working undercover to investigate corruption. Horrified, Slip and the others immediately go to the hospital to visit Chuck, but before Bowman can leave, he is menaced by Willy, the thug who works for a bookie to whom Bowman owes $5,000. Bowman promises to pay soon, while at the hospital, a tearful Slip vows vengence when Chuck reveals that  \"Big Greenie\" beat him. Bowman meets the boys at the hospital, and Slip decides to commit a real crime so that he, Sach and Butch will be sent to the penitentiary to find Chuck's attacker and uncover the corruption. Bowman agrees to the plan, which will require him to notify the prison's warden, Oswald, and the <I>     Blade     </I>'s editor of the boys's innocence, as well as hold the loot from their robbery for safekeeping. That night, the boys rob Potnick's jewelry store and leave many clues as to their identities, including fingerprints and a stamp stating \"Sach was here.\" The police are baffled about the crime, however, and do not arrest Slip and the others until Bowman makes an anonymous call implicating them. Unknown to the boys, as they are entering the penitentiary, Bowman sells the goods from Potnick's and uses the money to pay off his bookie. In the prison, the boys are taken by tough guard Jenkins to see Oswald, who has been the warden for only a few weeks. Oswald, who was not informed by Bowman about the undercover investigation, is puzzled by the boys's insistence that they will be leaving in a few weeks, and orders Jenkins to keep a close eye on them. Slip and his pals then meet their cellmate, Hank Gaffney, who reveals that he has been digging an escape tunnel for twenty-two years. After many problems trying to adapt to the prison work routine, the boys are ordered by Jenkins to mop floors. The area they are taken to houses gangster Percival P. Lannigan and his henchmen, including Tom Tomcyk and Big Greenie. Slip, Sach and Butch are amazed by Lannigan's lavishly appointed cell, as well as the gourmet food he is served and the luxurious clothes he wears instead of a uniform. They overhear him talk about the payoffs he makes to the guards, with Jenkins serving as his go-between, and watch as he slips a notebook filled with details of his payments into his desk. After the gangster orders Slip and Sach to clean his cell, they attempt to steal the notebook but fail. They then demand to see Oswald and tell him about their connection to Bowman. When Oswald calls Bowman, however, he denies knowing the boys. The warden then visits Lannigan's cell, but it has been transformed to look like everyone else's. Believing that the boys are insane, Oswald sends them to prison psychiatrist Fernando F. Fordyce, who is driven crazy by the boys's constant bickering. Slip realizes that Bowman has double-crossed them, and when Louie visits, tells him that he must take Chuck to see the editor of the <I>     Blade     </I> to verify their story. Greenie overhears their conversation and reports to Lannigan, who orders his men \"on the outside\" to pick up Louie and Chuck. When the boys return to their cells later, they learn from Hank that Lannigan intends to have them killed the following day, and that he has captured Louie and Chuck. Desperate to save their friends, the boys try to escape using Hank's tunnel, but it emerges in the warden's office. Just then, Oswald enters, but he assures the boys that he now believes them, as he made a surprise inspection of Lannigan's cell and found the luxury items they described. Before Oswald can alert the prison board, Lannigan, Tomcyk and Greenie arrive, and a brawl ensues. Through Sach's trickery, Tomcyk and Greenie plunge down into Hank's tunnel and are knocked unconscious, while Slip beats Lannigan into revealing where Louie and Chuck are being held. Slip gets Lannigan's notebook, then tosses him into the tunnel. Oswald calls the police, who rescue Chuck and Louie, then apologizes to the boys for doubting them. He promises to arrange for their releases but urges them to be patient. Much later, Slip, Sach and Butch are still in their cell, remembering Oswald's words about patience as they stroke their long beards.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "In Louie's Sweet Shop, Sach assists a police officer in recovering a bag of stolen diamonds by sniffing them out, then realizes that his sense of smell has been heightened by new antibiotic pills he is taking for a sinus condition. The owner of the diamonds, Alf Grimshaw, tells Sach and his pal Slip that they can become rich by using Sach's olfactory talent to recover a horde of lost diamonds in Africa. Grimshaw, Sach, Slip, and their friends Louie, Chuck and Butch then journey to Africa or, as Slip calls it, \"The Dark Condiment.\" They meet Grimshaw's partner, the ailing Holmes, at his trading post where he explains how another of their partners had found the diamonds, but was killed before he could tell Holmes where they were hidden. Before Holmes became ill, he and Grimshaw had searched the area, but had only been able to establish that the diamonds were hidden in a complex of caves. Dr. Goebel, Holmes' physician, is present when Holmes gives Sach a map of the route to the caves and warns him to guard it with his life. Later, Goebel and his crooked confederate, Shanks, decide to follow the expedition to the caves and steal the diamonds. The group sets off and on their first night in the jungle decides to build several fires to ward off lions. After Sach inadvertently uses the map to start his fire, he conceals the fact that it is been destroyed and instead leads them aimlessly in circles. Goebel, Shanks and their bearers are also following the same bewildering trail. After days of wandering, Sach  admits that the map is gone and that the paper he has been consulting is actually a mail-order girdle advertisement. The contrite Sach threatens to commit suicide, but changes his mind and is relegated to the rear of the group. As they stumble on through the jungle, a lion threatens Sach who is then rescued by Anatta, a curvaceous jungle woman who becomes enamored of him. When the others return to find Sach, Anatta runs away, and after the bearers see the dead lion, they assume that Sach killed it and proclaim him a great white hunter. Meanwhile, Goebel and Shanks visit Omotawa, a native chief, and arrange that he will kill all the strangers, except the one with the big nose. After the chief takes the boys prisoner, Goebel informs them that he and Sach will go diamond hunting the next morning while Slip and the others are turned into shrunken heads. Slip realizes that the only way they can escape their predicament is by disabling Sach's sense of smell, so they ensure that he catches a cold. The next morning, as Sach sneezes, Slip informs Goebel and Shanks that Sach cannot smell anything. Goebel and Shanks then take Sach to their hut where Rangori, the masked witch doctor, tries to cure his cold. Soon after, Anatta appears and knocks Rangori out, after which Sach dons Rangori's mask and robes and frees the others. After Sach recovers from his cold, Grimshaw convinces Anatta to take them to the caves, which are reputed to be haunted by a faceless ghost. Inside one of the caves, Sach and Slip collide, disabling Sach's nose when they hit their heads together. Sach accidentally finds the horde of diamonds, however, when he is chased by the ghost. Goebel and Shanks arrive and hold the group at gunpoint until the ghost reappears, enabling the boys to overpower them. The ghost is revealed to be Holmes, who has been tracking Goebel and Shanks, after having discovered that they had killed his partner. Later, as Slip, Louie, Chuck and Butch prepare to leave on a boat, they wave goodbye to Grimshaw, Holmes and Sach, who has donned a loincloth and decided to stay with Anatta. When Anatta's boyfriend, who looks like Tarzan, shows up, Sach runs off to join the others on their trip back to the Bowery.<BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Slip Mahoney and his gang, Sach, Whitey, Chuck and Butch, have just raised $1,683 for needy Bowery families at the Bowery Chowder Party, when thieves Red and Joe, posing as sailors, rob them of the money. During the robbery, Slip notices that one of the men has a heart with the name \"Marie\" tattooed on his chest and believes he can identify the robber with this clue. The neighborhood thinks that the hold-up was phoney, and even Louie Dumbrowsky, local soda parlor owner and friend to the boys, believes the gang concocted the story. When police officer Sgt. Mulloy refuses to help the gang because there is no tangible evidence to assist him in identifying the robbers, the boys decide to enlist in the Navy to find the robbers. While waiting at the local recruiting office, a paper mix-up causes the gang to be signed up under the wrong names. When they report for duty on the naval ship, Sach, whose enlistment paper read Algernon Hobbenocker, has a hard time pronouncing his name, much less remembering the fact that as Hobbenocker, he now has a wife and five children. As new recruits, Sach, Whitey, Butch and Chuck are assigned to swabbing the deck. They use the time to enact \"routine 11,\" in which they trip Naval personnel, pull their shirts up over their heads and check their chests for the tattoo. After Sach decides the swabbing could be done more efficiently with an electric floor waxer, their immediate superior, officer Longnecker, reprimands him for making the floors too slippery, then slides overboard. When Slip, who has been assigned to act as headwaiter for Comdr. Tannen, stops to talk to the gang, Whitey, who has been using a block of soap for the floors, accidentally trades it for a block of cheese on Slip's lunch platter for Tannen. Slip delivers the lunch and just before Tannen takes a bite out of his cheese and crackers, Longnecker, soaking wet, bursts into the office. Tannen finally takes a bite from the \"cheese,\" and when he sips his tea and an endless stream of bubbles floats out of his mouth. As a result, Slip is demoted to swabbing the deck. Sach, whose erroneous records show he is a qualified navigator, is assigned to the chart room. Suddenly a fire drill bell is sounded, and the gang is ordered to prepare a water hose. Sach, while searching for the chart room, sees his friends and attempts to help them by turning on the hose. The pressure is too strong for any of them to manage, however, and they soak all the sailors nearby, including Longnecker, who once again delivers Sach to Tannen's office for punishment. That night, the gang decides to check all the sailors for the tattoo while they sleep in their bunks. Longnecker, who is making the night rounds in the sleeping quarters, discovers Sach, who then feigns sleep walking into the shower room. When Longnecker asks Sach why he is taking a waterless shower, Sach turns on the water and soaks Longnecker again. Days later, the ship docks in Hawaii and the gang visit the famous tattoo artist, Chief Narumo, to see if he remembers creating the tattoo. Narumo, with the help of his daughter and translator Paphula, reports that he has no record of that particular tattoo, but gives Sach a parrot named Davie Jones. Back on board, Sach's continued antics force him to hide out in the cannon of one of the ship's guns to avoid punishment. When a firing drill commences, Sach is unaware of the impending danger, but Slip and the rest of the gang spot him and pull him out of the cannon just in time. Later Slip plays a few rounds of thimblerig with three small cups and a ball and is swindled out of all his remaining money. He leaves dejected, but Sach remains in the game, and with the help of the eagle-eyed Davie Jones, wins back all of Slip's money plus several thousand dollars. The gang then decides to return home with their winnings and discontinue looking for the robbers. Later, when they arrive back in the Bowery, Red and Joe attempt to rob the gang again, just as Longnecker suddenly appears and introduces the gang to his girl friend Kitten. Suspicious of the two strangers, Longnecker prompts the men to fight and punches one of them out. The rest of the gang pummel the other robber, while Sach practices his punches on the sidelines and accidentally hits Longnecker, who lands in the gutter where a street cleaning machine soaks him with its spray. Later, the gang receive commendations for their bravery and then return to the recruiting office to explain the false mix-up. At the office, the same five men with whom they were confused, are ready to sign up for service, but decide at the last minute not to join because Hobbenocker is having a seventh child. When their papers are messed up again, the gang, having enjoyed their world travels in the Navy, decide to sign up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Because of his quick temper, New Yorker Slip Mahoney loses job after job, exasperating his sister Mary.  After he is fired from a flower delivery job, Slip and his friends, Sach Jones, Bobby, Homer and Whitey, watch a salesman selling stain remover on the streets, and Slip, thinking that this is an easy way to make money, asks the salesman to cut him in on the business. At first, the salesman refuses, but when he learns that the police are on the way to arrest him, he agrees to sell the remaining bottles to the boys for ten dollars.  Slip then prepares to demonstrate the remover by spilling ink on the jacket of a passerby, and when he is unable to remove the stain, picks a fight with the man. Slip is trounced, but Sach manages to win back their money by placing bets on Slip's opponent, whom he has recognized as a former lightweight champion.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe following day, Slip applies for a job with Herbert Sayers, Mary's boss. Although Slip is sure that he will be hired in a managerial position, he is ordered to begin work at the bottom, shoveling dirt on a construction site.  Once again, however, he gets in a fight and loses the job. In a last attempt to hold down a job, Slip joins Sach, who is working as a \"skip tracer,\" repossessing goods from people who are behind on their payments. His first assignment is to take back a car from a singer named Jeanette, who works at the High Hat Club. At the club, Jeanette offers to get Slip a different job with her friends if he agrees to overlook her debt.  When he arrives at her apartment to meet her friends, he sees a photograph of Sayers, Mary's boss, on a table.  Jeanette claims that she and Sayers are no longer involved, but Slip is skeptical.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nJeanette does not really intend to find Slip a job, but plots to have him killed.  While they are driving to a meeting with the men who will commit the crime, however, Slip manages to repossess her car. Slip is so successful at his job that his boss, Barton, asks him and Sach to serve summons on Patsy Clark and Pigeon, who are being charged with running an auto theft ring.  Meanwhile, Sayers asks Mary to come to Mexico with him on business.  Assuming that Patsy is a woman, Slip confidently sets off to deliver the summons.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, Patsy turns out to be an enormous man, who has no intention of allowing Slip to take advantage of him. Posing as an employee of Patsy's out-of-town gangster pal, Slip waits for an opportunity either to escape or serve the summons.  While he is with Patsy, Slip learns that Pigeon is actually Sayers and is going to Mexico in order to avoid arrest. Eventually, Sach and the boys come to Slip's rescue, and the ensuing ruckus attracts the police, who arrest Patsy.  Slip and the boys then hurry to the airport to stop Sayers from leaving the country.  Mary is so proud of her brother that she punches Jeanette, who is boarding the plane, when she makes a disparaging comment about him.  Slip is delighted and pronounces his sister \"a real Mahoney.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Terence Alyosious \"Slip\" Mahoney and his friend, Sach Jones, work as runners for a Wall Street brokerage firm owned by David Thurston, whose daughter Carol is dating their friend Gabe Moreno, a television news commentator.  One afternoon, at Louie Dumbrowsky's malt shop, they turn on the television and see Gabe announcing Thurston's suicide.  Slip and Sach join Carol and Gabe at Thurston's office, where Slip finds a matchbook and pair of dice from the High Hat Club, a gambling establishment owned by Bruce McDermott. Suspicious about Thurston's death, Slip engages colorful Wellington Jefferson \"Buffer\" McGee to share his expertise in gambling with the boys.  At the end of their training, Slip and Sach rent tuxedos and go to the High Hat Club, and they watch as McDermott's beautiful associate, the Countess, entices some drunken conventioneers to join an exclusive crap game in the club's private gambling room.  Posing as conventioneers, Slip and Sach gain admission to the private room, and Slip's winning streak at the crap table draws the management's attention.  After Slip sees the dealer substitute the regular dice with a pair of loaded ones, he switches the loaded dice with a pair of his own, and he and Sach are soon escorted into McDermott's office.  McDermott says he is impressed by their skill at the table and offers them jobs, and Slip accepts, provided McDermott hire his entire five-man \"syndicate.\"  The next night, Slip and Sach, along with friends Whitey, Chuck and Butch, begin working as dealers.  Slip covertly searches McDermott's office, and finds a letter from Thurston saying that he has stopped payment on the check he wrote them and will expose McDermott's crooked operation.  Just then, McDermott and the Countess come into the office, and as Slip and Sach are leaving, intoxicated gambler Andrew Stone III bursts in and complains that McDermott runs a dishonest club. When Stone accuses McDermott of killing Thurston, McDermott hits him, and Stone hits his head on the fireplace and dies.  McDermott is exonerated, but the publicity affects the club's business, and he decides to fire Slip and the boys.  Slip saves their jobs, however, by promising to bring in a high-rolling Arizona cattleman the next night.  Later, McDermott and his henchman, Johnny Angelo, turn on the television and watch as Gabe announces that he may reveal the identity of \"Chick,\" McDermott's political connection, in his next broadcast.  The next night, Slip and Sach head for the club, leaving the boys at the malt shop to wait for Buffer, who will pose as the cattleman.  The boys try to call Gabe, who has been beaten up by McDermott's thugs, and while they are in the phone booth, Buffer arrives and is told by Louie that the boys have already left.  At the club, Slip and Sach are stalling McDermott when the boys arrive with Louie, who is dressed in western garb, and despite Louie's pathetic imitation of a high-roller, Slip makes sure he wins at craps.  McDermott is annoyed, but Slip promises that their \"pigeon\" will return the next night.  On the news that night, Gabe, broadcasting live from his hospital room, says that \"Chick\" is a highly regarded politician who has been protecting McDermott and other gambling interests, and that he is responsible for Thurston's death. Slip and Sach visit Gabe in the hospital, where they are introduced to Tom Whitney, from the district attorney's office.  The next night, \"Arizona Louie\" returns in high spirits, but McDermott replaces Slip and Sach with his own men, and Louie is soon wiped out.  Meanwhile, Tom and his men persuade the Countess to summon Chick, who turns out to be city council member John Martin, and she tricks him into admitting his crimes within Tom and Slip's hearing.  Slip and the boys help Tom apprehend McDermott and his men, and on his next broadcast, Gabe honors Slip and Sach as heroes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "In New York City's Bowery neighborhood, lawyer J. Ellison Higby gives Horace Debussy \"Sach\" Jones a letter in which Sach is identified as a potential heir to the estate of Sir Percy, Earl of Walsingham in England. The letter includes a first-class ticket for Sach to travel on a luxury steamship.  Sach's friend, Terence Aloysius \"Slip\" Mahoney, believes that Sach will need the support of his friends in England, and proposes trading in the ticket for four lower-class tickets for himself, and their friends, Butch Williams and Chuck Anderson.  When Louie Dumbrowski, the elderly owner of the sweets shop where the boys meet, attends a farewell party in the boys's cabin and is accidentally locked in the closet, the ship leaves port with Louie as an unwitting stowaway.  After witnessing the captain's cruel treatment of another stowaway, the boys keep Louie's presence a secret, and Slip orders Sach to spend the remainder of the trip in a steamer trunk so that it will appear there are only four residents in their cabin.  Upon arriving in London, Sach proves it was time well spent, by impressing his friends with his copious knowledge of London history, learned from reading a guidebook while he was trapped in the trunk.   At Walsingham Castle, meanwhile, Sach's fellow heirs, Sir Edgar Whipsnade, Lady Agatha, Sir Reggie, Sir Herbert and Lady Marcia, are plotting to rid themselves of Sach, whom they perceive as yet another competitor for Sir Percy's fortune. Sir Percy, however, warmly greets the Americans upon their arrival. Confined to a wheelchair, Sir Percy believes he is dying and announces that he hopes to get to know all his potential heirs and thereby make a fair division of his estate.  The Britons hope that Sach's uncouth American manners will soon put him out of Sir Percy's favor, but Sach's good nature impresses and invigorates the elderly man. The British heirs then plot to kill Sach after he convinces Sir Percy to discontinue taking his medicine and to eat for pleasure.  Both Sach and Sir Percy are unaware that the medicine is actually making him ill, as his relatives had planned, rather than making him well.   Working in collusion with the heirs, the butler Hoskins leads Sach and Slip to their rooms, and then frightens them with ghost stories.  That night, Sach's fears are realized when a hooded figure with a hatchet attempts to kill him.  After Sach is knocked unconscious by a helmet he had positioned over the bedroom door to stop an intruder, the hooded figure, actually Herbert in disguise, escapes.  The next morning, Sach appears to have been invigorated by his deep sleep.  Sir Percy's health continues to improve, and, no longer needing the wheelchair, he hosts a party to introduce his American guests.  The next day, Sir Percy thanks Sach for his kindness and informs him of his plan to correct a two-hundred-year old injustice wrought by Sir Percy's ancestor, Sir Charles, against Sach's ancestor.  Sir Percy recalls that the event occurred in the same chamber in which they now stand:  Sir Charles had accused Sir Horace Debussy Jones and his friends of passing worthless I.O.U.s at an inn, and banished them to Manhattan in New Amsterdam.  The friends were angry that they were being exiled to the colonies but were powerless against Sir Charles.  Having recounted the story, Sir Percy now appoints Sach as his principal heir. Sach goes to tell his friends the good news but is distracted by Marcia, who seduces him into revealing his secret.  Marcia and the other heirs then decide to kill Sir Percy before he can alter his current will.  Slip, meanwhile, realizes that Sach's indiscretion has put Sir Percy in danger, and so the friends split up to search for the earl, who has disappeared.  Unable to locate Sir Percy, Herbert and Reggie attempt to kill Sach, but he eludes them and stumbles into a torture chamber.  Several more attempts are made on Sach's life until someone mysteriously knocks out both Reggie and Herbert.  After Edgar appears and holds Sach and Slip, who has come to help his friend, at gunpoint, the mysterious assailant emerges and is revealed to be Sir Percy.  Hoskins enters the dungeon and asks Edgar's permission to shoot the men, but when he is given the gun, he proves his loyalty to Sir Percy by turning the weapon on Edgar, Herbert and Reggie. A swordfight erupts between the men while upstairs, Marcia and Agatha lock Butch and Chuck in a room.  Detective Ames of Scotland Yard arrives with the police, having been summoned earlier by Hoskins, and they arrest the women and free Butch and Chuck, who then lead them to the dungeon.  There they find that Edgar, Herbert and Reggie are securely locked up in the stocks, and that everyone else is safe.  Lawyer Higby arrives unexpectedly and announces that he mistakenly identified Sach as Sir Percy's relative, but that the true heir lives in Australia.  As if this news was not painful enough, Sach is accidentally knocked unconscious by several cannonballs that slip out of their mounts.  Sir Percy later congratulates a bandaged Sach for maintaining his dignity in the face of the bad news.  When Sach expresses his regret that he never got to go on a fox hunt, Sir Percy informs him that there have been no foxes in the area for hundreds of years.  Moments later, a fox chased by beagles runs through the room and both Sach and Sir Percy heed the call of the hunt. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Horace Debussy \"Sach\" Jones is reading <I>  Famous Predictions of Nostradamus  </I> in Louie Dumbrowsky's sweet shop when his Bowery cohort, Slip Mahoney, gets mad at him and hits him on the head with his hat. Sach then complains of a toothache and goes into a trance during which he predicts that their friend, Gabe Moreno, will walk through the door. Although Slip tells him that Gabe has just got a job and therefore would not be visiting Louie's, Sach replies that Gabe has already lost the job. Unconvinced, Slip is about to return the book to the library when Gabe walks in. Slip realizes that Sach has predicted the future and, after another demonstration of his abilities, decides to turn Sach into a carnival sideshow attraction. As \"Ali Ben Sachmo, The Bowery Prophet,\" Sach is able to predict the future as long as he is in a toothache-induced trance. To ensure his continued success, the boys force-feed him candy. Meanwhile, at the Forsythe Mansion, the crazed Dr. Druzik is injecting serum from human lymphatic glands into Atlas, his monster patient, in order to give him more human characteristics and turn him into the strongest man in the world. Atlas lacks a brain, but when Druzik sees a newspaper account of Sach's amazing mind he decides to transplant Sach's brain into his monster. Druzik and his assistant Otto attend one of Sach's shows and kidnap him. Sach wakes up in Druzik's laboratory and is introduced to Atlas while Druzik talks with his other assistant, Nancy Marlowe, whom he is blackmailing, about the master race he will create to do his bidding. Meanwhile, Slip thinks that Sach has gone to have his toothache cured and sends the boys to check all the local dentists. At the laboratory, Druzik transfers Sach's brain into Atlas' body by using electrical currents. After the procedure, Sach can only growl while Atlas has acquired Sach's voice and mannerisms. Atlas escapes and goes to the sweet shop where he terrorizes the boys, who eventually persuade him to take them to Sach. Meanwhile, Sach has been imprisoned in a cage but, by bending the bars, he escapes then suddenly becomes himself again. Atlas, too, reverts to his former being and attacks the boys as they are entering the mansion. After Druzik and his men find Atlas and Sach, he performs another \"treatment\" so they once more assume each other's characteristics. Gabe has arrived at the mansion but Whitey, one of the gang, mistakenly hits him on the head. He is soon discovered by Nancy, who agrees to help him, explaining that she is being blackmailed by Druzik about a patient's death, even though she was not responsible. Louie has tried to persuade the county constable to accompany him to the mansion but, as he believes it to be haunted, the officer refuses and Louie goes alone. Slip and the others are captured and forced to watch as Druzik begins a final, permanent transformation on Sach. However, Louie, dressed in a suit of armor, crashes into the operating room and destroys the equipment. Sach, in his Atlas persona, breaks loose from the table and attacks Louie, while Atlas tries to stop him. After Sach reverts to his usual self, he locks Atlas in a cage. The constable has decided to come after all, and arrests Druzik and his associates. Back at the carnival, Slip and the others feed Sach the usual candies, but discover that he has swallowed the tooth that induced the trance, thereby putting an end to his career as a prophet.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "In the Bowery neighborhood of New York City, Slip Mahoney and his friend Sach run the Bowery Boys Club, an athletic club for local children, in the back of their friend Louie's ice cream shop. When Sach recovers from a knockout by little Herbie while they are sparring, he discovers that he can read minds.  Shortly after, Louie's friend Eddie asks him to buy his detective agency for two hundred dollars.  Slip believes that Sach's new ability could be a goldmine for a detective agency, and encourages Louie to buy the business.  Slip is chagrined, however, when the first telephone call at their new business is from the landlord demanding five months' worth of unpaid rent.  Not long after, Myra Hagen, wearing a luxurious fur coat, rushes into the office claiming that someone is trying to kill her.  She gives Slip an envelope that contains information for the district attorney in the event of her death.  Sach places the envelope in their safe, unwittingly enclosing the safe's combination as well.  Sach then hides under the desk when a shadowy figure appears outside the office door.  Slip runs into the corridor to investigate but finds no one, and returns to discover that Myra has also disappeared.  On the street, Myra is taken hostage in her car by a man with a gun.  When a policeman stops by the detective agency, he examines the fur coat that Myra left behind and determines that it is one of many valuable fur coats stolen the night before.  Myra is taken to a health farm where Prof. Damon operates a theft ring that alters stolen coats from around the country for resale.  Myra, who has been part of the racket but now wants to get out, warns Damon about her incriminating letter.  At the detective agency, Slip tells John Graham, who claims to represent the insurance company investigating the fur coat thefts, about the letter.  Slip wants the reward Graham offers for the letter but cannot open the safe to get it out.  Slip later berates Sach for locking the combination in the safe, and Sach attempts to correct it by blowing up the safe with gunpowder.  Although Sach is unharmed, the explosion causes him to lose his psychic powers and the envelope still is not found.  Myra telephones them and, under duress from Damon, asks them to return the envelope. Two of Damon's thugs arrive to retrieve the letter, but because the boys are unable to find it, the thugs kidnap Herbie, who had been brought to the office to restore Sach's powers.  Karl, a dim-witted thug working for Damon who is fond of Myra, tells her about Damon's plans to kill her and Herbie.  Myra takes Karl's keys and finds Herbie, who then telephones to tell Slip that he and Myra are being held at the sanitarium.  Having finally found the envelope, Slip and Sach go to the sanitarium disguised as a doctor and his elderly female patient.  After nurse Aggie takes the feminized Sach to his room, he and Slip search for Herbie.  Sach encounters Graham, who is the ringleader of the racket, and after revealing his identity, gives Graham the envelope in hopes of receiving the reward.  Graham tells him to wait, but then sends his thugs after Sach.  Sach eludes them with Slip's help, and they then disperse in separate directions. Slip soon finds Myra and Herbie but when the door opens, Herbie strikes Sach, anticipating a thug.  The blow restores Sach's psychic powers.  After a brawl during which all of the thugs are trapped in a boiling vat, Herbie grabs the envelope from Graham and returns it to Slip.  Much later, the Bowery Boys Club celebrates its grand opening in a new location.  Sach explains to a party guest that he and Slip used the reward money to open the improved club to keep kids out of trouble.  However, several boys get into a food fight and Slip, Sach and Louie are hit in the face with pies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Benjamin Braddock, filled with doubts about his future, returns to his Los Angeles home after graduating from an Eastern college. His parents soon have a party so they can boast of their son's academic achievements and his bright prospects in business. Mrs. Robinson, one of the guests, persuades Ben to drive her home and there tries to seduce him, but her overtures are interrupted by the sound of her husband's car in the driveway. Blatant in her seductive maneuvers, she soon has the nervous and inexperienced Ben meeting her regularly at the Taft Hotel. As the summer passes, Benjamin becomes increasingly bored and listless; he frequently stays out overnight and returns home to loll around the pool. When his worried parents try to interest him in Elaine, Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Ben agrees to date her to avoid having the entire Robinson family invited to dinner. At first Benjamin is rude to Elaine and takes her to a striptease club, but realizing how cruel he has been, he apologizes and the two begin dating. Outraged, Mrs. Robinson demands that Ben stop seeing her daughter; instead he blurts out the truth to a shocked Elaine, who returns to college in Berkeley. Although Ben follows her and tries to persuade her to marry him, Elaine's parents intervene and encourage her to marry Carl, a student whom she has been dating. Ben returns to Los Angeles, but when Mrs. Robinson refuses to divulge any information about the wedding, he races back to Berkeley and learns that the ceremony will take place in Santa Barbara. Arriving at the church as the final vows are being spoken, he screams Elaine's name over the heads of the startled guests. Elaine sees her parents' anger toward Ben, and realizing what their influence has done, she fights off her mother and Carl and races to Ben. After locking the congregation in the church by jamming a crucifix through the door handles, the couple leap aboard a passing bus and ride away.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

There, model Rosa Senta gently admonishes Brandon for going out and leaving his wife home alone.  Brandon replies by offering Rosa his playboy creed, explaining that \"just because a man has one perfect rose at home, doesn't mean he can't enjoy the flowers of the field.\"   Brandon's philosophizing is cut short by the arrival of Isabel Lorrison, Brandon's beautiful and sharp-tongued former mistress, who forces Rosa to leave.   Isabel, back from a long stay in Paris, is intent on rekindling her romance with Brandon, but Brandon warns her to stay away because he is now faithful to his wife.   Later, as Brandon is leaving the club, Isabel's date for the night, Alec Dawning, who knows Brandon's playboy reputation, knocks him unconscious.  Brandon is rescued by Rosa, who takes him to her home, where he remains until early the next morning. Returning home just before dawn, Brandon tells Jessie that he was attacked by a bum, an excuse that she thinks is just another among the many she has heard before and ignored. Later that day, socialite Helen Lee reminds Jessie about her upcoming party for ex-police officer Mark Dwyer, whose book Helen's husband Owen is trying to get syndicated in his newspaper.   During the visit, Jessie confesses to Helen that she is afraid of what will happen to her marriage now that Isabel is back in town.  Her suspicions piqued by a newspaper photograph showing Rosa tending to her unconscious husband, Jessie finds Rosa and speaks with her about the incident.   Rosa quickly clears up the matter and the two hit it off so well that Jessie offers to take Rosa to the airport to pick up her sweetheart. By coincidence, Rosa's sweetheart is the charming Mark Dwyer, whose wandering gaze is soon cast in Jessie's direction.  On the day of Helen's party, Brandon is visited in his office by Isabel, who manages to entice him to her apartment and keep him from attending the party.  Jessie goes to the party alone and is taken home by Mark, who comforts her broken heart until Brandon returns.  The next day, Isabel summons Jessie to her apartment and tells her that she is determined to win her husband from her. Later, another strain is placed on Jessie's marriage when Mark, while giving her a tour of his West Side neighborhood, professes his love for her.  When Jessie returns home, she is greeted with news that Isabel has been murdered.  She and Mark immediately rush over to Isabel's apartment, where police Lt. Jacobi is busy interrogating Brandon.  Finding a clue that leads him to the Del Rio club, Mark reveals Isabel's killer to be Felice Backett, Alec's jealous girlfriend.  Although Brandon is found innocent of the murder, Helen has finally gotten up the courage to tell her husbend that she has fallen out of love with him and will be leaving him once and for all.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "During a cocktail party celebrating his engagement, a young Frenchman named Bliss is lured onto the terrace of his elegant Côte d'Azur apartment and pushed to his death by a mysterious woman dressed in white. A short time later, the woman appears in a rural mountain village. After enticing Robert Coral, a timid bank clerk, into inviting her to his dingy bachelor apartment, the woman kills him with poisoned wine. The third victim is René Morane, an aspiring politician with a wife and son. Once the wife has been tricked into leaving their suburban home to visit her mother, the woman poses as the son's teacher and gains entry into Morane's house; she locks him in a storage cupboard and leaves him to suffocate. Before each victim dies, the woman reveals that her name is Julie Kohler, the widow of a man who was shot to death on the steps outside the church where they were married. The fatal bullet had come from a building across the street where five men had been playing with a rifle which accidentally fired. After her mother prevented her from committing suicide, Julie vowed to have revenge on all of her husband's killers. Fourth on the list is Holmes, a dishonest car dealer, who is saved from Julie's vengeance when he is arrested by the police for handling stolen merchandise. Going on to her final victim, a painter known as Fergus, Julie agrees to be his model for a series of illustrations depicting Diana the Huntress. Although he eventually expresses his love for her, Julie kills him with the bow-and-arrow prop she used while posing. By deliberately not blacking out a wall painting Fergus made of her and then appearing at his funeral, Julie is easily recognized by Corey, a close friend of both the first and fifth victims. Openly admitting her guilt in the four murders, Julie is handed over to the police and imprisoned in the same jail where the fraudulent car dealer, Holmes, is now an inmate. While helping the matrons serve food to the prisoners, Julie takes a carving knife and completes her revenge by stabbing Holmes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

While considering his affair with Elizabeth, Rigby recalls the day in Washington, D.C., when his boss, Gibbs, first briefed him on the case:  Gibbs tells Rigby that a group of racketeers have been diverting war surplus items and airplane motors to Central America, where they are refitted and sold for profit. Assigned to locate the motors and raid the racketeers' headquarters, Rigby is told that the government suspects Elizabeth and her alcoholic war veteran husband Tug. After arriving in the Los Trancos town of Carlota, Rigby, posing as a sportsman, finds Elizabeth singing at Pedro's nightclub and befriends her. Rigby and Elizabeth soon strike up a romance, though Tug is either too drunk or too busy to notice. One night, at a bar, Rigby is approached by J. J. Bealer, a waterfront thief, who, after telling Rigby that he knows about his investigation, offers him $10,000 to leave the island. Rigby rejects the bribe, and soon comes to suspect that a man named Carwood, who is posing as a mine owner, is somehow associated with Bealer. The following day, in order to learn more about Carwood, Rigby joins him on a fishing trip.  The fishing expedition nearly proves fatal for Rigby when Carwood deliberately causes the fishing boat to lurch forward while Rigby is standing near the edge. Rigby is falls into the water, but Emilio Gomez, the boatman, jumps into the water and saves him.  Emilio, however, is killed by a shark while  trying to swim back to the boat. A short time later, Emilio's father Pablo confirms Rigby's suspicions that Carwood is the mastermind of the smuggling operation, and, angered by his son's death, volunteers to help Rigby investigate the men responsible. As Rigby comes out of his reverie, he is still torn between his love for Elizabeth and his obligation to investigate her. His decision is to save Elizabeth from prosecution by accepting Bealer's bribe and fleeing from the island with her. However, before Rigby can tell Elizabeth his plan, Bealer convinces Elizabeth that her husband is a criminal and that Rigby is an investigator who intends to put him in prison.  In the hope of saving Carwood's illicit operation, Tug enlists Elizabeth's help in drugging Rigby long enough to allow all those involved in the smuggling ring to flee. Rigby loses consciousness soon after drinking a cocktail tainted with a heavy sedative, but Elizabeth immediately feels remorse for what she has done. Carwood, meanwhile, murders Tug for talking too much, and makes preparations to flee. Rigby regains consciousness sooner than Carwood had anticipated, and sets out in search of his suspects.  When Rigby tries to arrest Carwood, Carwood shoots Bealer and escapes into a crowded carnival.  After killing Carwood, Rigby resumes his romance with Elizabeth, whom he now knows to be innocent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Late one night, in the year 1900, Roberto Columbo, an Italian lawyer living in New York's Little Italy neighborhood, secretly meets with police at the Carey Street Hotel to show them a threatening letter he received from the notorious Black Hand extortion gang. The letter indicates that the Black Hand is demanding that Roberto pay them protection money or face death. No sooner does Roberto begin to describe some of the gang members to the police than two mobsters enter the station and kill him. The murder devastates Roberto's wife Maria, who decides to return to Italy with her son Johnny. Eight years later, following the death of his mother, Johnny returns to New York vowing to avenge his father's death and end the Black Hand's operations. While looking for Black Hand gangsters, Johnny has a reunion with Isabella Gomboli, a childhood friend, who warns him that the mob is unstoppable and that he will be in great danger. Although Isabella's parents were killed by the Black Hand, she suggests that Johnny drop \"La Vendetta\" and form a citizen's league instead.  Johnny rejects Isabella's suggestion, though, and insists on meeting with Moriani, former owner of the Carey Street Hotel, who was with his father the night he was killed. Shortly after Johnny's meeting with Moriani, Moriani is found dead in his hotel room.  Hoping to steer Johnny away from trouble, police officer Louis Lorelli, a friend of Johnny's father, offers him a job in New Jersey and advises him to make a success of himself. Johnny eventually decides to take Isabella's advice and form a citizen's league when he discovers that Francesco, the son of tailor Benny Danetta, has been kidnapped by the Black Hand.  Francesco is released soon after the first citizen's league meeting is convened, but Johnny is punished by the Black Hand for organizing the group and is given a severe beating. Later, a bomb is found on the steps of Carlo Sabballera's dry goods store.   Johnny's investigation into the Black Hand leads to the arrest of George Allani, who is accused of placing the bomb in front of Sabballera's store.   At Allani's trial, Carlo is about to identify the gangster as the culprit when he is given the death sign by some Black Hand men. The frightened store owner  refuses to identify Allani, and, as a result, it appears that Allani will go free.  At the last moment, however, it is revealed that Allani is using an assumed name, and that he is really George Tomasino, an Italian fugitive.  The judge orders Tomasino's deportation, which gives Lorelli the idea to go to Italy to check Italian police records against his list of suspects. In Naples, Italy, Lorelli is shot and killed by Black Hand gangsters right after he mails a list of Italian criminals to Johnny. Back in New York, the Black Hand has kidnapped Isabella's younger brother Rudi, and is demanding the list of names as ransom. While attempting to rescue Rudi, Johnny is captured by the Black Hand. Johnny manages to escape by setting off a time bomb that kills everyone in the Black Hand headquarters except Caesar Xavier Serpi.  Serpi later engages Johnny in a fight with a pickax, but Johnny kills him with a knife. With Lorelli's list safely delivered to the police, Johnny is confident that he has put an end to the Black Hand operations in New York.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "After a delirious George Steele breaks a window at the Manhattan Museum and struggles wildly with a policeman, the museum's board, led by Dr. Lowell, expresses concern over his mental state.  While recuperating at Dr. Lowell's house, George, an art expert and lecturer recently released from military service, tells police lieutenant Cochrane that he was involved in a train wreck that night.  When the suspicious Cochrane informs George that no train wrecks have been reported, Dr. Lowell asks George to recall everything he can about the incident, and George relates the following story:  After one of his explosive public lectures, George is reprimanded by museum director Barton, who feels that George's lectures are too inflammatory. Barton also complains about George's promise to X-ray a famous painting to demonstrate how art forgeries are detected.  While an annoyed George then has a drink with Terry Cordell, his girl friend, he receives a telephone call summoning him to an out-of-town hospital to which his mother has supposedly been taken.  On the train to the hospital, George becomes engrossed in watching another train approaching on the opposite track, and as if by pre-design, his train collides with the other.  Back at Dr. Lowell's, George concludes his story, saying that after the crash, he found himself at the museum.  Traybin, an English art expert, confers secretly with Cochrane and asks him to have George tailed. George is then fired by Barton and discovers that his apartment has been torn apart.  When George confesses to Terry that he is worried that he is suffering from post-war stress, she tries to persuade him to forget that night.  George, however, is determined to discover the truth, and sets about reconstructing events leading up to the crash.  When no one on the commuter train remembers him from the night before, George gets off at the first stop and questions the station clerk, who recalls that two men got off the train with a drunk.  Having seen only one man helping a drunk board in New York, George concludes that he was the \"drunk\" at the station and rushes back to the museum to tell friend and employee Stevenson about his discovery.  Stevenson tells George that Barton has received information that a Thomas Gainsborough painting that had been reported lost at sea, was, in fact, a fake.  Sure that another forgery is at the museum, George decides to enlist Stevenson's help after hours to sneak into the building's vault.  That night, George arrives at the museum, finds Stevenson dead and is pursued by the police.  Although Terry and Traybin advise George to turn himself in to Cochrane, the now fugitive George refuses. Instead, George interrogates Barton, who was at the museum when Stevenson was killed, and Barton confesses that a museum painting by Gustave Doré, which is due to be shipped overseas, is most likely a forgery. George then overhears Traybin furtively discussing the imminent departure of the painting and races to the pier from which it is to be shipped.  After sneaking on board the ship, George finds the Doré in the cargo hold just as a fire is set.  The arsonist then locks George in the hold, but George is rescued by Traybin and Cochrane. Aided by Terry, George once again escapes from the police and asks Barton's young secretary, Mary, to help him locate an X-ray machine. George examines the Doré and confirms that it is indeed a fake, but is then knocked out by gun-wielding Mary, who takes him and Terry to her real boss, Dr. Lowell.  After Lowell confesses to George that he stole the paintings and used a mind-altering drug on him to prevent him from X-raying the Doré, he drugs George again to discover whether he has told anyone beside Terry about his findings. Although George reveals that he was unable to contact Cochrane, he and Terry are saved by the lieutenant and Traybin, who burst in and shoot Lowell. Terry then identifies Traybin as a Scotland Yard detective, and Cochrane convinces a frightened Mary to reveal the paintings' whereabouts.  Cleared of all guilt, George happily embraces Terry.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Name": "I Confess",
"Storyline": "In Quebec, in the sanctuary of his church late one night, Father Michael Logan finds Otto Keller, the German refugee who is employed as the rectory handyman. After asking Logan to hear his confession, the distressed Keller proceeds to tell how he killed a lawyer, Vilette, while trying to rob him. Later, Keller tells his wife Alma, who also works at the rectory, that Logan is barred from reporting the crime by the seal of the confessional. The next day, Keller proceeds to the Vilette mansion, where he is employed one day a week as gardener, and after returning the stolen money, alerts the police of Vilette's murder. The troubled Logan also appears at Vilete's, saying that he has an appointment, and is seen whispering to a woman on the street. Later, Inspector Larreau, who is in charge of the investigation, interviews two schoolgirls, who saw a priest leaving Vilette's house between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m. Suspicious of Logan, Larreau asks him to come to the station. Meanwhile, the anxious Keller hides the bloody cassock he wore on the night of the murder in Logan's room. At the station, Larreau questions Logan about his appointment with Vilette and the woman with whom he was seen, but Logan refuses to answer or provide an alibi for the night of the murder. Feeling certain that Logan is the killer, Larreau calls the Crown prosecutor, Willie Robertson, who is socializing with a member of Parliament, Pierre Grandfort and his wife Ruth, unaware that she was the woman outside Vilette's. The next day, Ruth secretly meets Logan on a ferry and tells him to admit to the police that they were together on the night of the murder, but Logan refuses, as he wants to protect her. However, Murphy, one of Larreau's men, sees them together and reports their meeting to Larreau. Reluctantly, Robertson asks Ruth to visit the station. There, with Larreau, Robertson, Pierre and Logan present, Ruth says she is being blackmailed and that she met with Logan on the night of the murder between nine and eleven o'clock to ask his advice. Although both Pierre and Logan try to protect her, Larreau presses for details. Believing the truth will prove Logan's innocence, Ruth tells a story that explains how she and Logan, who had been childhood sweethearts, were also in love as young adults: When war breaks out, Logan, always serious and noble, volunteers for military service and after a while, Ruth no longer hears from him. She eventually marries Pierre, but after the war, meets again with Logan. Without telling him she is married, she spends a day on an island talking to him. When a storm suddenly hits, they miss the last ferry out and take cover in a nearby summer house, where they spend a chaste night together. The next morning, Vilette, the owner of the house, spots them and recognizes Ruth. Afterward, she sees neither Logan nor Vilette. Five years later, Vilette shows up at Logan's ordination and continues to appear to Ruth in unlikely places. Later, Vilette threatens to blackmail her. Fearing scandal for both Pierre and Logan, Ruth meets with Logan to get his advice without telling Pierre. She and Logan plan to meet in front of Vilette's house the following morning, unaware that Vilette has been murdered. Back in the present, Robertson sends Logan and the Grandforts home, as Ruth has provided an alibi for Logan. However, Larreau tells Robertson that the autopsy report has placed Vilette's time of death after 11:30 p.m., which would have given Logan time to kill Vilette after meeting with Ruth, and that Ruth's testimony has suggested a motive for the killing. The next day, Keller taunts Logan about his vows, which require silence, but after seeing the dark look in Logan's eyes, he loads and pockets a gun. When Murphy arrives to see Logan, Keller embroiders a story about how Logan left in distress, which suggests that Logan is evading the police, but then Logan later shows up voluntarily in Larreau's office and is arrested. Meanwhile, the bloody cassock is found in a trunk during a search of Logan's room. Later, at the trial, as Alma watches, Keller testifies that Logan was in great distress on the night of the murder. Then Ruth's story is twisted by the prosecuting Robertson to insinuate an ongoing affair with Logan. In his testimony, Logan still does not reveal what he knows, nor does he implicate Keller when the cassock is shown as evidence. Although the jury acquits Logan for insufficient evidence, both judge and jury publicly express their suspicions. Logan is then free to go, but the disapproving mob almost crushes him. Seeing this, Alma tries to tell a policeman that Logan is innocent, but the panicked Keller kills her. Larreau, Logan and several policemen follow Keller to the Chateau Frontenac, and corner him in the ballroom. Believing that Logan has finally revealed the truth, Keller accuses him of hypocrisy by breaking his vow and thus, incriminates himself. When Logan moves closer to talk, Keller starts to shoot, but the police shoot Keller. As he dies, Keller asks for forgiveness, and Logan absolves him.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",

"Storyline": "Unknown to his friends and family, investment councilor Francis Warren secretly writes detective novels using the pseudonym F. X. Pettibone. One afternoon, Francis has an appointment with Leopold Fissue, a suspicious character who wants to convert his supply of uncut diamonds to cash.  When Francis objects, Fissue threatens to expose his secret life, so Francis reluctantly agrees to meet Fissue later that evening.  Fissue is late for the meeting, however, and eventually Francis leaves without seeing him.  Police inspector Mason, who knows Francis as Pettibone, ridicules his latest novel, stating that real crimes are not so easily solved.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nWhen Fissue's body is found on his yacht,  Francis, convinced that Fissue was murdered for his diamonds, decides to prove Mason wrong.  A series of theater tickets leads Francis to burlesque dancer Blondie White, who has a habit of holding two matches together until they fuse.  Having found two fused matches on the yacht, Francis is convinced that Blondie murdered Fissue, but her dentist, Dr. Davis, swears that she was in his office at the time of the murder. Meanwhile, Francis takes Blondie dancing as part of his investigation and is seen by friends of his wife Rita.  Rita believes that Francis is having an affair and hires a private investigator.  Blondie tells Francis that she must leave town to escape her ex-husband, Ace Vernon, and asks him for money.  She also asks him to retrieve her suitcase from a storage locker.  When Blondie does not show up, Francis rushes to her apartment, where the police, who have learned that Fissue was involved in a diamond smuggling ring, have found her dead body.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe police turn up a taxi driver who remembers driving a woman from Blondie's apartment to Francis' house.  Francis hurries home to beat the police and confronts Rita, who believes that he killed Blondie.  Francis, on the other hand, thinks that Rita is the murderer and urges her to leave town.  When the police finally arrive, Francis' double life is revealed, and Rita admits that she went to Blondie's apartment to talk to her about Francis.  Having found the missing diamonds in Blondie's suitcase, Francis realizes who Blondie's killer must be. He accuses Davis, who then attempts to inject Francis with the same poison that killed Fissue, not knowing that Francis has replaced it with water.  \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\nTipped off by Francis' chauffeur, the police arrest Davis.  Francis apologizes to Rita for keeping his writing a secret, but when he gets a call from Mason asking for his help in a new case, Rita is waiting to join him.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    ",
